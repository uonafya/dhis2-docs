            senior program manager at PSI. The aim of this interview was to find out more about how
            DHIS2 has been rolled out and how it is being used by PSI today. Sarah Romorini has
            worked with PSI for the past ten years, most recently with the implementation of DHIS
            2.</strong></span></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>About PSI:</strong></span> PSI is a global health organization
            dedicated to improving the health of people in the developing world by focusing on
            serious challenges like a lack of family planning, HIV and AIDS, barriers to maternal
            health, and the greatest threats to children under five, including malaria, diarrhea,
            pneumonia and malnutrition.</p><p>Founded in 1970, PSI provides lifesaving products, clinical services and behavior
            change communication that empower the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people to lead healthier
            lives. PSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local
            organizations to create health solutions that are built to last.</p><p>More than 8,900 staff work for PSI and its affiliates. Its world headquarters are in
            Washington, D.C. and its European offices are in Amsterdam. PSI works in more than 60
            countries. In 2014, PSI&#8217;s revenue was calculated at $631,229,922 USD.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Why did you choose DHIS2 at PSI, what drove the decision?</strong></span> In
            2011, PSI began its search for a better Management Information System (MIS). Until then,
            we&#8217;d been using a different MIS in every country and even within countries, different
            MISs would be used for different projects. We were stuck with highly customized
            &#8220;boutique&#8221; systems &#8211; that is, unique data collection systems for every project. This was
            a mix of a Microsoft Excel, Access, and other tools. Programs were cobbling together
            pieces of information to see trends and analyze their programs. Accessing data like this
            wasn&#8217;t very efficient.</p><p>All of these unique, siloed systems led PSI to reflect upon two larger questions: how
            does PSI want to engage with its information, both locally and globally? And how do we
            want data to influence both the strategic and everyday program questions that PSI
            tackles?</p><p>During its search for a new, global MIS, several different systems were considered but
            finally, DHIS2 was chosen for its ability to collect, manage, and visualize
            information&#8230;in essence, it was the system that made it easier for our programs to
            collect information and make decisions based off of data. It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful
            and flexible resource!</p><p>We were attracted to DHIS2&#8217;s ability to collect info on-the-go and the system&#8217;s
            ability to meet different needs. For example, users can set up their own entry forms,
            indicators and reports. DHIS2 is easily integrated with other interfaces; we especially
            liked that data collection and monitoring can be adapted for all program areas,
            including referrals, health services, sales and distribution.</p><p>Globally, PSI is making a huge push to make evidence-based decision-making easier for
            the field, and DHIS2 is a very tangible tool in that sense. Capturing and analyzing
            real-time data for decision making is appealing and relevant for our field programs and
            organizationally, it reinforces how PSI&#8217;s programs are truly data-driven.</p><p>

        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How did you roll out DHIS2? Was it a gradual process, district by district
                for example?</strong></span> No, we did it in true PSI fashion; we dived right in! We
            started with pilot projects that were rolled out nationwide in Kenya, El Salvador,
            Uganda and Senegal. It was a huge benefit to have a low-complexity country like El
            Salvador and a high-complexity country like Kenya and Uganda using DHIS2.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Kenya pilot project.</strong></span> Kenya was PSI&#8217;s largest pilot
            project for DHIS2. All the projects are now reporting on DHIS2. It was a very exciting
            process, as it was PSI&#8217;s first time implementing DHIS2 at scale. In Kenya, there&#8217;s a
            wide range of programs on DHIS2, including malaria, HIV, family planning, social
            franchising, hypertension, sales, cervical cancer, and others.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>El Salvador pilot project.</strong></span> In El Salvador, PSI&#8217;s
            reproductive health program was the first to join DHIS2. This helped monitor the
            effectiveness of interpersonal communication, quality assurance visits, provider
            performance, and helped the team identify trends and where to direct resources. I was a
            part of the El Salvador team at the time, and it was incredible to see how program
            managers and supervisors began using DHIS2 during meetings to illustrate trends, gaps,
            and program needs.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="left"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="531"><tr><td align="left"><img src="resources/images/use_cases/psi_scale.png" align="left" width="531"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How many PSI countries are using DHIS2?</strong></span> After setting up our two
            pilot projects, DHIS2 grew very quickly at PSI&#8230;we created demand for this system and
            needed to meet other countries&#8217; requests to introduce DHIS2. From 2013 until now, PSI
            has over 20 countries reporting their data using DHIS2 on the production server and
            several more are in development. Over 60 PSI countries use DHIS2 to report their monthly
            aggregated health services data. With such a powerful tool, program managers can make
            better, data-driven decisions, which ultimately translates into improved
            programming.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What are the differences between how PSI uses DHIS2 and how the Ministries
                of Health do?</strong></span> PSI and MoHs are using the same MIS, that is to say DHIS2,
            but they are not using the same server. This means that the information on PSI&#8217;s DHIS2
            server and the information on the MoH&#8217;s DHIS2 server are managed separately. Since PSI
            and the MoH capture different information, PSI&#8217;s is not creating a parallel system to
            the MoH. However, it enables the potential to share the information gathered by the
            other. In a few countries, MoHs have access to the information collected by PSI in their
            DHIS2 server.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How is DHIS2 making changes to its programs and businesses?</strong></span> DHIS2
            could be used as just another MIS for data collection, but fortunately it&#8217;s used for so
            much more. What we&#8217;re really interested in is seeing the programs using the information
            on DHIS2 to influence their program decision making.</p><p>This is also part of a larger behavior change process to make better use of data and
            we&#8217;re asking ourselves:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>How do we make sure that program managers are using this information to
                        direct where resources should be better used?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who should we target to use information to drive changes within programs
                        and ensure that evidence-based decision-making is being applied?</p></li></ul></div><p>DHIS2 has enabled us to see how we&#8217;re performing in various areas of Behavior Change
            Communication (BCC). For example, we&#8217;ve better visibility on what our Interpersonal
            Communication (IPC) agents are doing. We can see the number of people that IPC agents
            have reached, the BCC activities that are taking place, and so forth.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How do you implement DHIS2? Do you use consultants or local PSI
                teams?</strong></span></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Local PSI DHIS2 stars.</strong></span> We&#8217;re working closely with
            PSI&#8217;s country teams so they feel empowered to use, manage, and analyze their data using
            DHIS2. During DHIS2 implementations, in-country DHIS2 stars are identified and PSI
            provides coaching and assistance to empower them to integrate data for decision
            making&#8212;and DHIS2!&#8212;into their every day program management.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>We also identify local technical leads who can support DHIS2 maintenance and adapt
                the system to meet their teams&#8217; needs. For example, we&#8217;re implementing DHIS2 in
                Zimbabwe and have an amazing MIS star there. Our team is working closely with him,
                and he&#8217;s learning how to build and do the configuration himself&#8212;and this includes
                some pretty complex integrations. It&#8217;s exciting to see how DHIS2 is really owned by
                PSI Zimbabwe&#8212;the data in DHIS2 is theirs and they&#8217;re using it. This is the kind of
                goal we aspire to.</p><p>

            country&#8217;s data needs takes team work. To do this, PSI collaborates with &#8220;DHIS2
            builders,&#8221; who do the technical configuration work&#8230;that is, building the DHIS2 system to
            match the DHIS2 blueprint, which is based on the PSI country team&#8217;s data use
            needs.</p><p>These DHIS2 builders are often HISP agencies in India, Vietnam, Uganda, West Africa,
            and Colombia. We also work with BAO Systems, the largest US-based DHIS2 consulting and
            hosting firm in North America, for configuration support.<a class="link" href="https://baosystems.com/" target="_top">https://baosystems.com/</a> As
            I mentioned before, we are also training PSI&#8217;s local DHIS2 stars to lead
            configurations.</p><p>To make sure DHIS2 configuration work meets PSI&#8217;s standards, DHIS2 builders are
            supervised by PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 Architects. The DHIS2 Architects are an important part of our
            team and are specialized PSI DHIS2 experts&#8212;they not only make sure PSI&#8217;s DHIS2
            configurations are high quality, but they also train local DHIS2 stars and help DHIS2
            builders to learn PSI&#8217;s standards so our configurations become more efficient.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Do you provide DHIS2 training to PSI staff?</strong></span>  As part of our
            long-term sustainability goals, we&#8217;re offering more training opportunities for local PSI
            staff on DHIS2 administration and data use using DHIS2, as well as for DHIS2 builders so
            they familiarize themselves with PSI standards. Before, we would create these trainings
            a little on the fly because there were fewer countries, but now we&#8217;re starting to create
            more standard, ready-to-go training resources. This helps us to save time and improve
            our curriculum based off of experience&#8212;this is also part of our strategy to reach scale.
            We also send PSI staff to the introductory and advanced trainings that HISPs
            offer.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Which parts of DHIS2 are you using the most?</strong></span>  Probably the
            aggregate data forms. But I&#8217;d like to see PSI using Tracker even more&#8230;.it&#8217;s an
            incredibly flexible tool! More and more countries are using the DHIS2 tracking feature.
            You can look at individual data, register individual cases, track individual cases and
            then conduct surveys. This means that you can capture detailed information and then
            analyze this information, to get the bigger picture about what&#8217;s going on. </p><p>Within PSI, we have a large network of franchised clinics and there are ongoing
            discussions about the direction we want to take with electronic medical records and
            Clinic Management Information Systems. So&#8230;whatever solution we&#8217;re proposing needs to be
            DHIS-2 compatible. Now we&#8217;re at the point where we&#8217;re asking ourselves: What&#8217;s DHIS2&#8217;s
            limit? </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How do you go about customizing DHIS2? </strong></span>  Right now we&#8217;re focusing
            on strengthening how we implement DHIS2 and the process we use. We&#8217;re identifying what
            needs to happen and when, and the information we need to understand how the PSI country
            team will use DHIS2. Each country has its unique configuration, but there are core
            business processes that remain the same. So we&#8217;re identifying how this connects to the
            information that we need to see and the decisions that we need to make. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What&#8217;s the general feedback you get on DHIS2?</strong></span>  It&#8217;s an incredibly
            powerful tool, but it&#8217;s not necessarily intuitive to create your own form or how you
            create your own dashboard. Sometimes that can be a barrier for PSI country teams to make
            full use of DHIS2. We&#8217;re looking to make that easier, and we&#8217;re identifying who really
            needs to be able to do what with DHIS2. For example, does a senior manager really need
            to create her own dashboard, or is it OK that someone else does it for her, if she can
            access and see her dashboards? Based off of this, we can understand who needs to be
            trained on what. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How do you help DHIS2 users with the system?</strong></span>  We&#8217;ve recently
            transitioned to BAO Systems to help PSI to field its Help Desk tickets. For example, if
            a user gets stuck with a dashboard query, they submit a ticket through the Help Desk,
            which is mainly answered by BAO, with support from PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 Architects. We try to
            have a local DHIS2 administrator in each PSI country we work in; this person can usually
            field basic questions, like how to reset a password, or intermediate ones, like how to
            create a new form. Questions in the Help Desk range from basic to advanced, like
            reporting a bug, which may need to be sent to Oslo.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Do you embed DHIS2 into other apps?</strong></span>  Absolutely! In addition to
            using DHIS2 as our MIS, PSI develops custom reports and apps to make real time data
            collection and analysis even easier. Different apps address key strategic and technical
            areas, including franchise management and provider performance, improving network
            quality, and case surveillance (such as malaria). All the information collected via apps
            is directly pushed into DHIS2. Analytics are automatically updated, giving users
            real-time information and visual analytics that makes data-driven decision making
            easier. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Health Network Quality Improvement System (HNQIS)
                app.</strong></span> The HNQIS app was developed by PSI with the aim to improve network
            quality and provider performance. It&#8217;s an impressive app that responds to a very real
            program need: How do we improve the quality of care that providers deliver more
            effectively? It helps Quality Assurance (QA) officers plan their supervision routes and
            target low-performing providers with high client volume. QA officers use PSI- and
            MoH-approved checklists in the app to conduct assessments with PSI&#8217;s providers. QA
            officers can easily monitor trends in network quality and identify how best to allocate
            their time and resources to improve their providers&#8217; performance. This app can be used
            both on and offline.</p><p>

            anyone who can use a smartphone can use it. Pharmacists and other health providers use
            this app to collect basic data points - like geographic location, type of malaria
            detected and age/gender of the client. This information helps PSI and our partners to
