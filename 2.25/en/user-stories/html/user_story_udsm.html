                implement integrated Health Information Systems (HIS) in Tanzania

                promoting collaboration; ensuring systems were flexible; promoting data ownership
                and data sharing; building capacity at all levels; involving major programs very

            population of 45 million people. It's composed of two countries: the semi-autonomous
            island of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, or Tanzania Mainland. Tanzania Mainland is divided
            into 25 administrative regions that are subdivided into 167 district councils. Each
            district council is subdivided into divisions, wards, villages/streets. There's
            approximatively one health facility per 8.000 people, according to SARA (2012).</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="left"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="354"><tr><td align="left"><img src="resources/images/use_cases/new_map_tanzania.png" align="left" width="354"></td></tr></table><div class="caption">Source: BBC News Africa &copy; 2016</div></div></div><p>Owing to a huge disparity between regions and districts in terms of geography,
            history, population, and infrastructure, some areas of Tanzania have no reliable roads,
            electricity, or access to the Internet.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e280"></a>Moving from multiple tools to a unified system</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e283"></a>Before DHIS2</h3></div></div></div><p>Tanzania Mainland's first HIS began in the 90s as a paper-based system used at
                health facilities and district offices. Information was collected and processed with
                a Microsoft Access database. Without the intervention of external consultants hired
                by funding agencies, there weren't any strategies to sustain the system with
                upgrades or refresher training.</p><p>With a surge in demand for a HIS, the MoHSW was being put under strain. Lack of
                coordination led to fragmented vertical projects running side by side. This caused
                an unsustainable situation in which efforts were being duplicated as results weren&#8217;t
                being converged.</p><p>Around 2007, a plan called the Monitoring and Evaluation Strengthening Initiative
                was made by the MoSWH, UDSM, UiO and other partners. Its goal was to build a new,
                integrated HIS to provide reliable data for the ministry and other stakeholders. A
                new paper-based system combined with DHIS2 was introduced. <a class="link" href="http://www.dhis2.org" target="_top">http://www.dhis2.org</a></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e293"></a>Introducing an integrated HIS in Tanzania</h3></div></div></div><p>In 2010, the adaptation and implementation of a totally revised HIS began. This process was
                enabled by a flexible, standard solution and participatory approaches operating
                across all levels of the national health system. It was important to find a solution
                that would meet the demands of health managers, implementers, designers and
                decision-makers.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e298"></a>A gradual, national HIS rollout</h3></div></div></div><p>In 2011, the coastal region of Pwani was used as a testbed for paper-based data collection
                    tools and DHIS2. Over the next two years, revised systems were rolled out to
                    the remaining 24 regions and associated districts and health facilities of
                    Tanzania Mainland. On completion of this rollout, efforts were directed towards
                    the integration of all major vertical programs such as malaria, TB/leprosy, RCH,
                    HIV/AIDS into DHIS2. Along with the implementation process, training programs
                    were held for implementing partners, district and regional hospital staff, and
                    the MoHSW staff.</p><p>

                    HIS</h3></div></div></div><p>Here are some of the key areas we dedicated time and resources to:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e324"></a>Open-source philosophy</h4></div></div></div><p>The choice to apply open-source tools rather than going through a closed, commercial product ensured that the software remained collaborative with a more diverse and flexible scope of design. Furthermore, the involvement of the many health sector stakeholders and an open source community of developers implied that the system would be geared towards long-term sustainability rather than a short-term lifecycle, dependent on a company&#8217;s paid maintenance services.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e329"></a>Incremental, flexible, and scalable design</h4></div></div></div><p>DHIS2 was implemented in an incremental way, rather than in one go. Like that, issues could
                        be tackled directly during the rollout process, and implemented in direct
                        response to user feedback. The most glaring flaws were thus easily spotted
                        and a more stable and efficient system was built.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e334"></a>Standards for data collection</h4></div></div></div><p>We used a set of common data collection standards that covered data collection, reporting,
                        analysis, and quality procedures and tools. All informal tools were removed
                        and the recording of duplicate entries of data declined. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e339"></a>Participatory design</h4></div></div></div><p>A community of users such as managers from the HIS, supporting partners and implementers
                        exchanged emails, spoke on forums, and at workshops about how to make the
                        software more user-friendly. This helped implementers fine-tuned their
                        programs and ensure that DHIS2 was being used optimally.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e344"></a>Action-led research</h4></div></div></div><p>Students enrolled on PhD and MSc degree programs at UiO and UDSM conducted &#8220;action-led
                        research&#8221; that enabled them to participate in the roll-out of DHIS2 while
                        doing research. By doing so, they learned and documented best practices
                        about system customization, user support, training, and data
                        analysis.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e349"></a>Local capacity building</h4></div></div></div><p>People learned to troubleshoot DHIS2 software, and users were encouraged to assist each other
                        across many different organization levels and roles. By instilling a sense
                        of ownership and self-sufficiency, the gap between implementers and users
                        was thus reduced. Training focused on software usage, data analysis and
                        basic and advanced features of DHIS2 for health and data managers.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e354"></a>Using information guidelines and standards</h4></div></div></div><p>To drive decision-making and to reach national health goals, annual planned targets, and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), teams created processes on how to generate and use data efficiently. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e359"></a>Interoperability of DHIS2 with other systems</h4></div></div></div><p>Since 2014, DHIS2 has been integrated with other software systems, enabling health workers to cross-cut, analyze and share data across organizations.

The foundation of a
                new region generates a new representation of local population data. This disruption
                has an impact on the comparative analysis of HIS data such as the performance of

                DHIS2, streamline all resources and HIS activities of all stakeholders and use the
                MoHSW as a lead organization. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e475"></a>Establish a trustworthy relationship</h3></div></div></div><p>Promote system and data ownership within the MoHSW.
