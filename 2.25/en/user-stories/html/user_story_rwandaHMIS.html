With improved data reporting timeliness, completeness, and accuracy, R-HMIS has made sweeping changes to how health data is being collected and used in Rwanda today.</strong></span></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What did the situation look like before R-HMIS?</strong></span>With a system
                        that was stretched to its limits, and lacking in capacity to gather data
                        efficiently, it could at times take months to receive health reports from
                        remote areas of the country. The data that eventually came through was
                        likely to have passed through multiple sources and was usually not very
                        reliable. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been better for a completely new
                        system.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>A huge turnaround since February 2012.</strong></span>With the arrival of R-HMIS, web reports from every health facility in the country can be made available in a few clicks. Furthermore, data validation rules are keeping the data clean and of near to perfect quality. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>A country rollout achieved in 4 years &#8211; absolute record time!</strong></span>After spending almost two years of thorough preparation, it took just two years for Rwanda&#8217;s highly dedicated teams to roll out DHIS2 across Rwanda and make it the country&#8217;s official web-based Health Information System.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Harmonizing an existing system. </strong></span>Resources such as people, registers, modems and computers were already available, so DHIS2 implementers took advantage of this infrastructure and focused on getting DHIS2 software up and running. Furthermore, in an effort to get everyone involved simultaneously, health personnel received intensive DHIS2 training at the same time as systems administrators working at the central level.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>A concisely prepared rollout.</strong></span><span class="italics">"We
                                harmonized all the reporting forms,"</span>recalls Andrew
                        Muhire, the head of Rwanda's Health Management Information System at the
                        Ministry of Health. "We ensured that we were only collecting highly relevant
                        data or data that had direct links to our strategic plan. We selected
                        program indicators that were linked to our targets: reducing the overall
                        workload of our health personnel and improving the quality of data to drive
                        decision making."</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>A thoroughly revised system.</strong></span>The Rwandan DHIS2 experts went to great lengths to meet as many requirements as possible.  For example, they revised data collection tools, including patient forms and registers, and health facility reporting tools. Standard operating procedures for data management at health centers and district hospital levels were introduced along with a routine data quality audit (DQA) system. Finally, referral hospitals, private dispensaries and clinics were integrated.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Getting teams up to speed with web-based technology was a priority. </strong></span>Intensive training took place very early on in the process. The aim was clear, the motivation was high: to empower local teams with the expertise necessary to control their country's health data. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Data quality assessments showing excellent results.</strong></span>Data completeness is hovering at around 98% today. People at all levels within the health sector use the collected data; at district and at central level.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Migration of eIDSR, HIV and the TB system into DHIS2.</strong></span>We&#8217;re continually progressing with our HMIS; eIDSR - our disease surveillance system, HIV and TB systems are now migrated to DHIS2.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong> eIDSR in a few words: </strong></span>Using web technology or a mobile phone app, eIDSR enables users to collect and report real-time epidemic surveillance data from health facilities. Data is stored in a central database, where it can be instantly retrieved for analysis, dashboards and decision-making. Automated alerts and reporting reminders can also be triggered to keep health officers informed about potential outbreaks and reporting delays.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="user_story_akros_EMIS.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="user_story_palestine_tracker.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Zambia Education Management System (EMIS)&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="user_stories_book.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;DHIS2 tracker e-Registry in Palestine</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
