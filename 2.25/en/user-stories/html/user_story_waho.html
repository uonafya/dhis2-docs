        UiO has assisted WAHO in building HIS capacity within the organization and in its member states. In 2013, an online regional data warehouse was set up using DHIS2.</p><p>At WAHO, the focus is on aligning data, disease and epidemiological surveillance technology, quality control and improved data standards.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Tackling how to better align our data.</strong></span>The disparity in the
            size of our member countries is a challenge. Take Nigeria and Gambia as examples of a
            huge country and a tiny country using DHIS2. Now imagine the challenge WAHO teams face
            when setting up a system to map data levels correctly between such hugely different
            structures, and consequently in the number and the size of the administrative
            levels.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Flexible Integrated Architecture.</strong></span>To address this situation,
            WAHO has developed a system called &#8220;Flexible Integrated Architecture&#8221; which groups data
            across three levels: one national level, and two sub-national administrative levels. The
            aim is to let each country decide which administrative levels in their country
            correspond to each of these levels in the regional data warehouse. This approach allows
            for comparison of data between countries of different size and with different
            organizational structures.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;What is WAHO looking to do with the data?&#8221;</strong></span>This is a question
            we&#8217;re often asked. For a start, we&#8217;re collecting data to provide countries with better
            visibility about outbreaks of epidemics. When you hear that there&#8217;s been an outbreak of
            say cholera in a country, you&#8217;ve no time to lose. With WAHO-DHIS2, we have a better
            chance of making decisions fast as we can read data, measure, and assess data, and act
            accordingly. When there&#8217;s an outbreak in a border area, there&#8217;s a high risk that
            infections will spread into the neighboring country. This is where the WAHO-DHIS2
            technology can be used to share preventive information across several countries.</p><p>

There are currently about 80 essential indicators in the regional data warehouse. They cover many areas such as demographics, disease burden, health service utilization, health financing, human resources and epidemic diseases. At the moment it is the epidemiological indicators that are being reported by countries, but the plan is to expand with the rest in 2016. There is indeed no one size to fit all and that is why WAHO is taking things on a case-by-case basis; working out which countries would benefit the most from certain sets of indicators more than other countries would. In the long run, if we can identify the right data measuring tools for each country, the data we will then collect will be of higher quality, which will drive better decision making.</p><p>The WAHO data warehouse is still in its early days. However, the organization is on the right track to building a solution that will, we all hope, bring unity and cohesion to how data is shared in the ECOWAS region.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="user_stories_book.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="user_story_akros_EMIS.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Collection of User Stories&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="user_stories_book.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Zambia Education Management System (EMIS)</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
