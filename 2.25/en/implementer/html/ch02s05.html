This is a major advantage of having a database system for HIS as supposed to a paper-based or even spreadsheet based system. The system is designed to store large amounts of data and always allow drill-downs to the finest level of detail possible, which is only limited by how the data was collected or imported into the DHIS2 database. In a perspective of a national HIS it is desired to keep the data disaggregated by health facility level, which is often the lowest level in the orgunit hierarchy. This can be done even without computerising this level, through a hybrid system of paper and computer. The data can be submitted from health facilities to e.g. district offices by paper (e.g. on monthly summary forms for one specific facility), and then at the district office they enter all the facility data into the DHIS2 through the electronic data collection forms, one facility at a time. This will enable the districts health management teams to perform facility-wise data analysis and to e.g. provide print-outs of feedback reports generated by the DHIS2, incl. facility comparisons, to the facility in-charges in their district.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.4.&nbsp;Indicator-driven data analysis and reporting&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.6.&nbsp;Support data analysis at any level in the health system</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
