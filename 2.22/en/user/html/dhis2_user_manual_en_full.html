  <p>The DHIS2 documentation is a collective effort and has been developed by the development team and users. While the guide strives to be complete, there may be certain functionalities which have been omitted or which have yet to be documented. This section explains some of the conventions which are used throughout the document. </p>
  <p>DHIS2 is a browser-based application. In many cases, screenshots have been included for enhanced clarity. Shortcuts to various functionalities are displayed such as "Maintenance-&gt;Data administration". The "-&gt;" character indicates that you should choose "Maintenance" and then click on "Data administration" in the menu which appears through the browser. </p>

    <p>DHIS 2 is a tool for collection, validation, analysis, and presentation of aggregate and patient-based statistical data, tailored (but not limited) to integrated health information management activities. It is a generic tool rather than a pre-configured database application, with an open meta-data model and a flexible user interface that allows the user to design the contents of a specific information system without the need for programming. DHIS2  is a modular web-based software package built with free and open source Java frameworks.</p>
    <p>DHIS 2 is open source software released under the BSD license and can be obtained at no cost. It runs on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE 7 or higher) installed. </p>
    <p>DHIS 2 is developed by the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP) as an open and globally distributed process with developers currently in India, Vietnam, Tanzania, Ireland, and Norway. The development is coordinated by the University of Oslo with support from NORAD and other donors.</p>
    <p>The DHIS 2 software is used in more than 40  countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and countries that have adopted DHIS 2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and organisations are starting up new deployments.</p>
    <p>The documentation provided herewith, will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the application. Given the abstract nature of the application, this manual will not serve as a complete step-by-step guide of how to use the application in each and every circumstance, but rather will seek to provide illustrations and examples of how DHIS2 can be implemented in a variety of situations through generalized examples.</p>
    <p>Before implementing DHIS 2 in a new setting, we highly recommend reading the DHIS 2 Implementation Guide (a separate manual from this one), also available at the main DHIS2 <a class="ulink" href="http://dhis2.org/documentation/" target="_top">website</a>.</p>

      the information cycle presented in Figure 1.1 below. The information
      cycle pictorially depicts the different components, stages and processes
      through which the data is collected, checked for quality, processed,

        </li></ul></div><p>
  </p>
    <p>As a first step, DHIS 2 serves as a data collection, recording and
      compilation tool, and all data (be it in numbers or text form) can be
      entered into it. Data entry can be done in lists of data elements or in
      customised user defined forms which can be developed to mimic paper based forms in order to ease the process of data entry.</p>
    <p>As a next step, DHIS 2 can be used to increase data quality.
      First, at the point of data entry, a check can be made to see if data
      falls within acceptable range levels of minimum and maximum values for
      any particular data element. Such checking, for example, can help to
      identify typing errors at the time of data entry. Further, user can
      define various validation rules, and DHIS 2 can run the data through the
      validation rules to identify violations. These types of checks help to ensure that data entered into the system is of good quality from the start, and can be improved by the people who are most familiar with it. </p>
    <p>When data has been entered and verified, DHIS 2 can help to make
      different kinds of reports. The first kind are the routine reports that
      can be predefined, so that all those reports that need to be routine
      generated can be done on a click of a button. Further, DHIS 2 can help
      in the generation of analytical reports through comparisons of for
      example indicators across facilities or over time. Graphs, maps, reports
      and health profiles are among the outputs that DHIS 2 can produce, and
      these should routinely be produced, analysed, and acted upon by health
      managers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e137"></a>1.4.&nbsp;Technical background</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e139"></a>1.4.1.&nbsp;DHIS as a platform</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 can be perceived as a platform on several levels. First, the application database is designed ground-up with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as data elements, organisation units, forms and user roles can be defined completely freely through the application user interface. This makes it possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of locale contexts and use-cases. We have seen that DHIS 2 supports most major requirements for routine data capture and analysis emerging in country implementations. It also makes it possible for DHIS 2 to serve as management system for domains such as logistics, labs and finance.</p>
      <p>Second, due to the modular design of DHIS 2 it can be extended with additional software modules or through custom apps. These software modules/apps can live side by side with the core modules of DHIS 2 and can be integrated into the DHIS 2 portal and menu system. This is a powerful feature as it makes it possible to extend the system with extra functionality when needed, typically for country specific requirements as earlier pointed out.</p>
      <p>The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts several constraints on the development process. The developers creating the extra functionality are limited to the DHIS 2 technology in terms of programming language and software frameworks, in addition to the constraints put on the design of modules by the DHIS 2 portal solution. Also, these modules must be included in the DHIS 2 software when the software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically during run-time. </p>
      <p>In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling between the DHIS service layer and additional software artifacts, a REST-based API has been developed as part of DHIS 2. This Web API complies with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies that:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to the complete DHIS 2 data model. For instance, one can access the full list of data elements, then navigate using the provided URL to a particular data element of interest, then navigate using the provided URL to the list of data sets which the data element is a member of. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>(Meta) Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using plain HTTP requests. There are no fancy transport formats or protocols involved - just the well-tested, well-understood HTTP protocol which is the main building block of the Web today. This implies that third-party developers can develop software using the DHIS 2 data model and data without knowing the DHIS  2specific technology or complying with the DHIS 2 design constraints. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as resources in REST terminology, can be retrieved in most of the popular representation formats of the Web of today, such as XML, JSON, PDF and PNG. These formats are widely supported in applications and programming languages and gives third-party developers a wide range of implementation options.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e152"></a>1.4.2.&nbsp;Understanding platform independence</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All computers have an Operating System (OS) to manage it and the
        programs running it. The operating system serves as the middle layer between the
        software application, such as DHIS 2, and the hardware, such as the
        CPU and RAM.    DHIS 2 runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and can therefore run on any operating system which supports Java. Platform
        independence implies that the software application can run on ANY OS -
        Windows, Linux, Macintosh etc. DHIS 2 is platform independent and thus can be used in many different contexts depending on the exact requirements of the operating system to be used.</p>
      <p>Additionally, DHIS 2 supports three major database management systems systems  (DBMS). DHIS 2 uses the Hibernate database abstraction framework and is compatible with the following database systems:  PostgreSQL, MySQL and H2. PostgreSQL and MySQL are high-quality production ready databases, while H2 is a useful in-memory database for small-scale applications or development activities.</p>
      <p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, since DHIS2 is a browser-based application, the
        only real requirement to interact with the system is with a web browser. DHIS2 supports most
        web browsers, although currently either Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera are
        recommended.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e157"></a>1.4.3.&nbsp;Deployment strategies - online vs offline</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 is a network enabled application and can be accessed over the Internet, a local intranet as well as  a locally installed system. The deployment alternatives for DHIS 2 are in this chapter defined as i) offline deployment ii) online deployment and iii) hybrid deployment. The meaning and differences will be discussed in the following sections.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e160"></a>1.4.3.1.&nbsp;Offline Deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>An off-line deployment implies that multiple standalone off-line instances are installed for end users, typically at the district level. The system is maintained primarily by the end users/district health officers who enters data and generate reports from the system running on their local server. The system will also typically be maintained by a national super-user team who pay regular visits to the district deployments. Data is moved upwards in the hierarchy by the end users producing data exchange files which are sent electronically by email or physically by mail or personal travel. (Note that the brief Internet connectivity required for sending emails does not qualify for being defined as on-line). This style of deployment has the obvious benefit that it works when appropriate Internet connectivity is not available. On the other side there are significant challenges with this style which are described in the following section.</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span> Running stand-alone systems requires advanced hardware in terms of servers and reliable power supply to be installed, usually at district level,  all over the country. This requires appropriate funding for procurement and plan for long-term maintenance.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software platform:</strong></span> Local installs implies a significant need for maintenance. From experience, the biggest challenge is viruses and other malware which tend to infect local installations in the long-run. The main reason is that end users utilize memory sticks for transporting data exchange files and documents between private computers, other workstations and the system running the application. Keeping anti-virus software and operating system patches up to date in an off-line environment are challenging and bad practices in terms of security are often adopted by end users. The preferred way to overcome this issue is to run a dedicated server for the application where no memory sticks are allowed and use an Linux based operating system which is not as prone for virus infections as MS Windows.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software application:</strong></span> Being able to distribute new functionality and bug-fixes to the health information software to users are essential for maintenance and improvement of the system. Relying on the end users to perform software upgrades requires extensive training and a high level of competence on their side as upgrading software applications might a technically challenging task. Relying on a national super-user team to maintain the software implies a lot of traveling.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Database maintenance: </strong></span>A prerequisite for an efficient system is that all users enter data with a standardized meta-data set (data elements, forms etc). As with the previous point about software upgrades, distribution of changes to the meta-data set to numerous off-line installations requires end user competence if the updates are sent electronically or a well-organized super-user team. Failure to keep the meta-data set synchronized will lead to loss of ability to move data from the districts and/or an inconsistent national database since the data entered for instance at the district level will not be compatible with the data at the national level.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e176"></a>1.4.3.2.&nbsp;Online deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>An on-line deployment implies that a single instance of the application is set up on a server connected to the Internet. All users (clients) connect to the on-line central server over the Internet using a web browser. This style of deployment is increasingly possible due to increased availability in (mobile) Internet coverage globally, as well as readily available and cheap cloud-computing resources. These developments make it possible to access on-line servers in even the most rural areas using mobile Internet modems  (also referred to as <span class="italic">dongles</span>).  </p>
        <p>This on-line deployment style has huge positive implications for the implementation process and application maintenance compared to the traditional off-line standalone style:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span> Hardware requirements on the end-user side are limited to a reasonably modern computer/laptop and Internet connectivity through a fixed line or a mobile modem. There is no need for a specialized server for each user, any Internet enabled computer will be sufficient. A server will be required for on-line deployments, but since there is only one (or several) servers which need to be procured and maintained, this is significantly simpler (and cheaper) than maintaining many separate servers is disparate locations. Given that cloud-computing resources continue to steadily decrease in price while increasing in computational power, setting up a powerful server in the cloud is far cheaper than procuring hardware. </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software platform:</strong></span> The end users only need a web browser to connect to the on-line server. All popular operating systems today are shipped with a web browser and there is no special requirement on what type or version. This means that if severe problems such as virus infections or software corruption occur one can always resort to re-formatting and installing the computer operating system or obtain a new computer/laptop. The user can continue with data entry where it was left and no data will be lost.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software application:</strong></span> The central server deployment style means that the application can be upgraded and maintained in a centralized fashion. When new versions of the applications are released with new features and bug-fixes it can be deployed to the single on-line server. All changes will then be reflected on the client side the next time end users connect over the Internet. This obviously has a huge positive impact for the process of improving the system as new features can be distributed to users immediately, all users will be accessing the same application version, and bugs and issues can be sorted out and deployed on-the-fly.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Database maintenance: </strong></span>Similar to the previous point, changes to the meta-data can be done on the on-line server in a centralized fashion and will automatically propagate to all clients next time they connect to the server. This effectively removes the vast issues related to maintaining an upgraded and standardized meta-data set related to the traditional off-line deployment style. It is extremely convenient for instance during the initial database development phase and during the annual database revision processes as end users will be accessing a consistent and standardized database even when changes occur frequently.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
        <p>This approach might be problematic in cases where Internet connectivity is volatile or
          missing in long periods of time. DHIS2 however has certain features which requires
          Internet connectivity to be available only part of the time for the system to work
          properly, such as offline data entry. In general however, DHIS 2 does require Internet connectivity of some sort, but this is increasingly an easy problem to solve even in remote locations. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e195"></a>1.4.3.3.&nbsp;Hybrid deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>From the discussion so far one realizes that the on-line deployment style is favourable over the off-line style but requires decent Internet connectivity where it will be used. It is important to notice that the mentioned styles can co-exist in a common deployment. It is perfectly feasible to have on-line as well as off-line deployments within a single country. The general rule would be that districts and facilities should access the system on-line over the Internet where sufficient Internet connectivity exist, and off-line systems should be deployed to districts where this is not the case. </p>
        <p>Defining decent Internet connectivity precisely is hard but as a rule of thumb the download speed should be minimum 10 Kbyte/second for the client and at least 1 MBit/sec (dedicated) bandwidth for the server.</p>
        <p>In this regard mobile Internet modems which can be connected to a computer or laptop
          and access the mobile network is an extremely capable and feasible solution. Mobile
          Internet coverage is increasing rapidly all over the world, often provide excellent
          connectivity at low prices and is a great alternative to local networks and poorly
          maintained fixed Internet lines. Getting in contact with national mobile network companies
          regarding post-paid subscriptions and potential large-order benefits can be a wort-while
          effort. The network coverage for each network operator in the relevant country should be
          investigated when deciding which deployment approach to opt for as it might differ and
          cover different parts of the country.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e200"></a>1.4.3.4.&nbsp;Server hosting</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The on-line deployment approach raises the question of where and how to host the server which will run the DHIS 2 application. Typically there are several options:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Internal hosting within the Ministry of Health</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Hosting within a government data centre</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Hosting through an external hosting company</p>
          </li></ol></div>
        <p>The main reason for choosing the first option is often political motivation for having &#8220;physical ownership&#8221; of the database. This is perceived as important by many in order to &#8220;own&#8221; and control the data. There is also a wish to build local capacity for server administration related to sustainability of the project. This is often a donor-driven initiatives as it is perceived as a concrete and helpful mission.</p>
        <p>Regarding the second option, some places a government data centre is constructed with a view to promoting and improving the use and accessibility of public data. Another reason is that a proliferation of internal server environments is very resource demanding and it is more effective to establish centralized infrastructure and capacity.</p>
        <p>Regarding external hosting there is lately a move towards outsourcing the operation and administration of computer resources to an external provider, where those resources are accessed over the network, popularly referred to as &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; or &#8220;software as a service&#8221;. Those resources are typically accessed over the Internet using a web browser. </p>
        <p>The primary goal for an on-line server deployment is provide long-term stable and high-performance accessibility to the intended services. When deciding which option to choose for server environment there are many aspects to consider:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Human capacity for server administration and operation. There must be human resources with general skills in server administration and in the specific technologies used for the application providing the services. Examples of such technologies are web servers and database management platforms.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Reliable solutions for automated backups, including local off-server and remote backup.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Stable connectivity and high network bandwidth for traffic to and from the server.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Stable power supply including a backup solution.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Secure environment for the physical server regarding issues such as access, theft and fire.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Presence of a disaster recovery plan. This plan must contain a realistic strategy for making sure that the service will be only suffering short down-times in the events of hardware failures, network downtime and more.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Feasible, powerful and robust hardware.</p>
          </li></ol></div>
        <p>All of these aspects must be covered in order to create an appropriate hosting environment. The hardware requirement is deliberately put last since there is a clear tendency to give it too much attention.</p>
        <p>Looking back at the three main hosting options, experience from implementation missions in developing countries suggests that all of the hosting aspects are rarely present in option one and two at a feasible level. Reaching an acceptable level in all these aspects is challenging in terms of both human resources and money, especially when compared to the cost of option three. It has the benefit that is accommodates the mentioned political aspects and building local capacity for server administration, on the other hand can this be provided for in alternative ways.</p>
        <p>Option three - external hosting - has the benefit that it supports all of the mentioned hosting aspects at a very affordable price. Several hosting providers - of virtual servers or software as a service - offer reliable services for running most kinds of applications. Example of such providers are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linode.com" target="_top">Linode</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_top">Amazon Web Services</a>. Administration of such servers happens over a network connection, which most often anyway is the case with local server administration. The physical location of the server in this case becomes irrelevant as that such providers offer services in most parts of the world. This solution is increasingly becoming the standard solution for hosting of application services. The aspect of building local capacity for server administration is compatible with this option since a local ICT team can be tasked with maintaining the externally hosted server, but with not being burdened with worrying about power supply and bandwidth constraints which usually exist outside of major data centres.</p>
        <p>An approach for combining the benefits of external hosting with the need for local hosting and physical ownership is to use an external hosting provider for the primary transactional system, while mirroring this server to a locally hosted non-critical server which is used for read-only purposes such as data analysis and accessed over the intranet.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Patient data</em></span> is data relating to a single patient, such as his/her
      diagnosis, name, age, earlier medical history etc. This data is typically based on a single
      patient-health care worker interaction. For instance, when a patient visits a health care
      clinic, a variety of details may be recorded, such as the patient's temperature, their
      weight, and various blood tests. Should this patient be diagnosed as having "Vitamin B 12
      deficiency anaemia, unspecified" corresponding to ICD-10 code D51.9, this particular
      interaction might eventually get recorded as an instance of "Anaemia" in an
      aggregate based system. Patient based data is important when you want to track longitudinally
      the progress of a patient over time. For example, if we want to track how a patient is
      adhering to and responding to the process of TB treatment (typically taking place over 6-9
      months), we would need patient based data.</p>
    <p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>Aggregated data</em></span> is the consolidation of data
      relating to multiple patients, and therefore cannot be traced back to a
      specific patient. They are merely counts, such as incidences of Malaria,
      TB, or other diseases. Typically, the routine data that a health
      facility deals with is this kind of aggregated statistics, and is used
      for the generation of routine reports and indicators, and most importantly, strategic planning within the health system. Aggregate data cannot provide the type of detailed information which patient level data can, but is crucial for planning and guidance of the performance of health systems. </p>
    <p>In between the two you have case-based data, or anonymous "patient" data. A lot of details can be collected about a specific health event without necessarily having to identify the patient it involved. Inpatient or outpatient visits, a new case of cholera, a maternal death etc.  are common use-cases where one would like to collect a lot more detail that just adding to the total count of cases, or visits. This data is often collected in line-listing type of forms, or in more detailed audit forms. It is different from aggregate data in the sense that it contains many details about a specific event, whereas the aggregate data would count how many events of a certain type, e.g. how many outpatient visits with principal diagnosis "Malaria", or how many maternal deaths where the deceased did not attend ANC, or how many cholera outbreaks for children under 5 years. In DHIS 2 this data is collected through programs of the type single event without registration.</p>
    <p>Patient data is highly confidential and therefore must be
      protected so that no one other than doctors can get it. When in paper,
      it must be properly stored in a secure place. For computers, patient
      data needs secure systems with passwords, restrained access and audit logs.</p>
    <p>Security concerns for aggregated data are not as crucial as for
      patient data, as it is usually impossible  to identify a particular person to a aggregate statistic . However,
      data can still be misused and misinterpreted by others, and should not
      be distributed without adequate data dissemination policies in place. </p>

    <p>Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to
        operate. The human authored and human readable form of those
        instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually
        execute the instructions, the source code must be translated into a
        machine readable (binary) format, called the object code. All
        distributed software includes the object code, but <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> makes the
        source code available as well.</p>
    <p>Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object
        code to a user, which allows the user to run the program. <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr>
        programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source
        code, permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the
        programs. With access to the source code, the users have the freedom
        to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
        from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release
        improvements to the public for the good of the community. Hence, some
        <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> is also known as free software, where &#8220;free&#8221; refers, first and
        foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of
        the word.</p>
    <p>Within the public health sector, <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> can potentially have a
        range of benefits, including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive
            license costs.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Given the information needs for the health sector are
            constantly changing and evolving, there is a need for the user to
            have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
            This is often limited in proprietary systems.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Access to source code to enable integration and interoperability. In the health sector interoperability between different software applications is becoming increasingly important, meaning enabling two or more systems to communicate metadata and data.    This work is a lot easier, and sometimes dependent on the source code being available to the developers that create the integration. This availability is often not possible
            in the case of proprietary software. And when it is, it comes at a
            high cost and contractual obligations.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>FOSS applications like DHIS 2 typically are supported by a
            global network of developers, and thus have access to cutting edge

      <p>The DHIS 2 Live package is the easiest way to get started with DHIS2 on your local computer. DHIS2 Live is appropriate for a stand-alone  installation and demos.  Simply download the application from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dhis2.org/downloads" target="_top">here</a>. 
        Once the file is downloaded,  you can simply double-click the downloaded file, and get started using DHIS 2. </p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e276"></a>2.2.1.1.&nbsp;Prerequisites for DHIS 2 Live</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>You must be sure that you have a current version of the Java Runtime installed on your machine. Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing Java. The reader is referred to this <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_top">website</a> for detailed information on getting Java installed.</p>

      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e280"></a>2.2.1.2.&nbsp;Starting up with a blank database</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The live package comes with a demo database just like what you see on the <a class="ulink" href="http://apps.dhis2.org/demo/" target="_top">online demo</a> (which is based on the national Sierra Leone HMIS), and if you want to start with a blank system/database and build up your own system then you need to do the following:
</p>
        <p>1) Stop DHIS2 live if it is already running.  Right click on the tray icon  and select Exit.
The tray icon is  the green symbol on the bottom right of your screen (on Windows) which  should say' DHIS 2 Server  running'  when you hover your mouse pointer over the icon.</p>
        <p>2) Open the folder where the DHIS 2 live package is installed  and locate the folder called "conf".
</p>
        <p>3) In conf/ open the file called 'hibernate.properties' in a text editor (notepad or similar) and do the following modification:
locate the string 'jdbc:h2:./database/dhis2' and replace the 'dhis2' part with any name that you want to give to your database (e.g. dhis2_test).</p>
        <p>4) Save and close the hibernate.properties file.
</p>
        <p>5) Start DHIS 2 Live by double-clicking on the file dhis2-live.exe in the DHIS 2 Live installation folder or by using a desktop shortcut or menu link that you might have set up.
</p>
        <p>6) Wait for the browser window to open and the login screen to show, and then log in with username: admin and password: district
</p>
        <p>7) Now you will see a completely empty DHIS 2 system and you should start by adding your users, organisational hierarchy, data elements, and datasets etc. Please refer to the other sections of the user manual for instructions on how to do this.

    <p>Regardless of whether you have installed the server version of the
    desktop Live version, you will use a web-browser to log on to the
    application. DHIS2 should be compatible with most modern web-browsers,
    although you will need to ensure that Java Script is enabled.</p>
    <p>To log on to the application just enter <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost:8080/dhis" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/dhis</a> if you
    are using the DHIS2 live package, or replace <code class="varname">localhost</code> with the name or IP
    address of the server where the server version is installed.</p>
    <p>Once you have started DHIS2, either on-line or off-line, the displayed
    screen will prompt you to enter your registered user-name and
password. After entering the required information click on log-in button
    to log into the application. The default user name and password are 'admin' and 'district'. They should be changed immediately upon logging on the first time.</p>

    <p>You can select the language which you wish to display DHIS2 in from the "Change language" dialog box at the bottom of the screen. Not all languages may be available. </p>
    <p>Should you have forgotten your password, you can click on the "Forgot password?" link. You must have informed DHIS2 of your email address and the server must be properly configured to send emails. </p>
    <p>If you want to create your own account (and the server administrator allows this), simply click "Create an account" and follow the directions provided. </p>

    <p>DHIS 2 provides a powerful  set of tools for data collection, validation, reporting and analysis, but the contents of the database, e.g. what to collect, who should collect it and on what format will depend on the context of use. However, in order to do anything with DHIS 2, you must first create meta-data. Meta-data, or data about the data, describes what should be collected (data elements and categories), where it should be collected (organisation units) and how frequently it should be collected (periods).  This meta-data needs to be created in the DHIS 2 database before it can be used. This  can be done through the user interface and requires no programming or in-depth technical skills of the software, but does require a good understanding of the processes which you are trying to collect data form. </p>
    <p>This section will provide a very quick and brief introduction to DHIS 2 database design and mainly explain the various steps needed to prepare a new DHIS 2 system for use. How to do each step is explained in other chapters, and best practices on design choices will be explained in the implementers manual. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
    <p>1. Set up an organisational hierarchy</p>
    <p>2. Define data elements</p>
    <p>3. Define data sets and data entry forms</p>
    <p>4. Define validation rules</p>
    <p>5. Define indicators</p>
    <p>6. Define report tables and design reports</p>
    <p>7. Set up the GIS module</p>
    <p>8. Design charts and customise the dashboard</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e324"></a>2.5.1.&nbsp;The organisational hierarchy</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation using the DHIS 2, the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas used in data collection and data analysis.  This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in DHIS 2.</p>
      <p> The design of this hierarchy will determine the  geographical units of analysis available to the users  as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. Additional  hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative groupings such as "Facility ownership") can be modelled using organisational groups and group sets, however the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations, e.g. a Country or MoH unit (the root) might have e.g. 8 parent units (provinces), and each province again ( at  level 2) might have 10-15  districts as their children. Normally the health facilities will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </p>
      <p>Typically there is a geographical hierarchy defined by the health system. e.g. where the administrative offices are located (e.g. MoH, province, district), but often there are other administrative boundaries in the country that might or might not be added, depending on how its boundaries will improve data analysis.   When designing the hierarchy the number of children for any organisational unit may indicate the usefulness of the structure, e.g. having one or more  1-1 relationships between two levels is not very useful as the values will be the same for the child and the parent level. On the other extreme a very high number of children in the middle of the hierarchy (e.g. 50 districts in a province) might call for an extra level to be added in between  to increase the usefulness of data analysis. The lowest level, the health facilities will often have a large number of children (10-60), but for other levels higher up in the hierarchy approx. 5-20 children is recommended. Too few or too many children might indicate that a level should be removed or added.</p>
      <p> Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g.  splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. Refer to the chapter on Organisation Units to learn how to create organisational units and to build up the hierarchy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e330"></a>2.5.2.&nbsp;Data Elements</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The Data Element is perhaps the most important building block of a DHIS 2 database. It represents the "WHAT" dimension, it explains  what is being collected or analysed. In some contexts this is referred to an indicator, but in DHIS 2 we call this unit of collection and analysis a <span class="italic">data element</span>. The data element often represents a count of something,  and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. "BCG doses given" or "Malaria cases". When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented it is the data elements or expressions built upon data elements that describes the WHAT of the data. As such the data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is collected, but more importantly  how the data values are represented in the database, which again decides how data can be analysed and presented. </p>
      <p>It is possible to add more details to this "WHAT" dimension through the disaggregation dimension called data element categories. Some common categories are Age and Gender, but any category can be added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element's name and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system, and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of this dimension, but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the WHAT dimension). Changes to data elements and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive and careful steps in the database design process.</p>
      <p>One best practice when designing data elements is to think of data elements as a unit of data analysis and not just as a field in the data collection form. Each data element lives on its own in the database, completely detached from the collection form, and reports and other outputs are based on data elements and expressions/formulas composed of data elements and not the data collection forms. So the data analysis needs should drive the process, and not the look an feel of the data collection forms. A simple rule of thumb is that the name of the data element must be able to stand on its own and describe the data value also outside the context of its collection form. E.g.  a data element name like "Total referrals" makes sense when looking at it in either the "RCH" form or the "OPD" form, but on its own it does not uniquely describe the phenomena (who are being referred?), and should in stead be called "Total referrals from Maternity" or "Total referrals from OPD". Two different data elements with different meanings, although the field on the paper form might only say "Total referrals" since the user of the form will always know where these referrals come from. In a database or a repository of data elements this context is no longer valid and therefore the names of the data elements become so important in describing the data.   </p>
      <p>Common properties of data elements can be modelled through what is called data element groups. The groups are completely flexible in the sense that they are defined by the user, both their names and their memberships. Groups are useful both for browsing and presenting related data, but can also be used to aggregate data elements together. Groups are loosely coupled to data elements and not tied directly to the data values which means they can be modified and added at any point in time without interfering with the raw data. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e337"></a>2.5.3.&nbsp;Datasets and data entry forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All data entry in DHIS 2 is organised through the use of Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection, and in the case of distributed installs they also define chunks of data for  export and import between instances of DHIS 2 (e.g. from a district office local installation to a national server). Datasets are not linked directly to the data values, only through their data elements and frequencies, and as such a dataset can be modified, deleted or added at any point in time without affecting the raw data already captured in the system, but such changes will of course affect how new data will be collected. </p>
      <p>A dataset  has a period type which controls the data collection frequency, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly. Both which data elements to include in the dataset and the period type is defined by the user, together with a name, short name, and code.</p>
      <p>In order to use a dataset to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign the orgunit to the dataset, and this mechanism controls which orgunits that can use which datasets, and at the same time defines the target values for data completeness (e.g. how many health facilities in a district expected to submit RCH data  every month). </p>
      <p>A data element can belong to multiple datasets, but this requires careful thinking as it may lead to overlapping and inconstant data being collected if e.g. the datasets are given different frequencies and are used by the same orgunits.  
</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e343"></a>2.5.3.1.&nbsp;Data entry forms</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Once you have assigned a dataset to an orgunit that dataset will be made available in Data Entry (under Services) for the orgunits you have assigned it to and for the valid periods according to the dataset's period type. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the dataset together with a column for inputting the values. If your dataset contains data elements with categories such as age groups or gender, then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the categories. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e346"></a>2.5.3.1.1.&nbsp;Section forms</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms
            and are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables
            with subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table
            (e.g. some categories do not apply to all data elements), both of these functions are
            supported in section forms. After defining a dataset you can define it's sections
            with subsets of dataelements, a heading and possible grey fields i the section's
            table. The order of sections in a dataset can also be defined. In Data Entry you can now
            start using the Section form (should appear automatically when sections are available
            for the selected dataset). You can switch between default and section forms in the top
            right corner of the data entry screen. Most tabular data entry forms should be possible
            to do with sections forms, and the more you can utilise the section forms (or default
            forms) the easier it is for you. If these two types of forms are not meeting your
            requirements then the third option is the completely flexible, although more
            time-consuming, custom data entry forms.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e349"></a>2.5.3.1.2.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. In DHIS 2 there is a  built in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly using the Source window in the editor. In the custom form you can insert static text or data fields (linked to data elements + category) in any position on the form and you have complete freedom to design the layout of the form.   Once a custom form has been added to a dataset it will be available in data entry and used automatically. You can switch back to default and section (if exists) forms in the top right corner of the data entry screen. </p>

      <p>Once you have set up the data entry part of the system and started to collect data then
        there is time to define data quality checks that help to improve the quality of the data
        being collected. You can add as many validation rules as you like and these are composed of
        left and right side expressions that again are composed of data elements, with an operator
        between the two sides. Typical rules are comparing subtotals to totals of something. E.g. if
        you have two data elements "HIV tests taken" and "HIV test result
        positive" then you know that in the same form (for the same period and organisational
        unit) the total number of tests must always be equal or higher than the number of positive
        tests. These rules should be absolute rules meaning that they are mathematically correct and
        not just assumptions or "most of the time correct". The rules can be run in data
        entry, after filling each form, or as a more batch like process on multiple forms at the
        same time, e.g. for all facilities for the previous reporting month. The results of the
        tests will list all violations and the detailed values for each side of the expression where
        the violation occurred to make it easy to go back to data entry and correct the
        values.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e355"></a>2.5.5.&nbsp;Indicators</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Indicators represent perhaps the most powerful data analysis feature of the DHIS 2. While data elements represent the raw data (counts) being collected the indicators represent formulas providing coverage rates, incidence rates, ratios and other formula-based units of analysis. An indicator is made up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both  expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator "BCG coverage &lt;1 year" is defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator ("BCG doses given to children under 1 year") and a denominator ("Target population under 1 year"). The indicator "DPT1 to DPT3 drop out rate" is a formula of 100 %   x ("DPT1 doses given"- "DPT3 doses given") / ("DPT1 doses given"). </p>
      <p>Most report modules in DHIS 2 support both data elements and indicators and you can also combine these in custom reports, but the important difference and strength of indicators versus raw data (data element's data values) is the ability to compare data across different geographical areas (e.g. highly populated vs rural areas)  as the target population can be used in the denominator.</p>
      <p>Indicators can be added, modified and deleted at any point in time without interfering with the data values in the database. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e360"></a>2.5.6.&nbsp;Report tables and reports</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Standard reports in DHIS 2 are a very flexible way of presenting the data that has been collected. Data can be aggregated by any organisational unit or orgunit level, by data element, by indicators, as well as over time (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly). The report tables are custom data sources for the standard reports and can be flexibly defined in the user interface  and later accessed in external report designers such as iReport or through custom HTML reports. These report designs can then be set up as easily accessible one-click reports with parameters so that the users can run the same reports e.g. every month when new data is entered, and also be relevant to users at all levels as the organisational unit can be selected at the time of running the report.</p>

    <p>A data value in DHIS2  is  described by at least three dimensions: 1) data element, 2) organisation unit, and 3) period. These dimensions  form the core building blocks of the data model. </p>
    <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="800"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/datavalue_with_dimensions.png" align="middle" width="800"></td></tr></table></div>
    <p>As an example, if you want to know how many children that were immunised for measles in Gerehun CHC in December 2014, the three dimensions which describe that value are the Data Element "Measles doses given", the Organisation Unit "Gerehun CHC", and the Period "Dececmber 2014". All data values have at least these three dimensions describing What, Where and When.</p>
    <p>In addition to the organisation unit, period and data element dimensions, data values may also be associated with a custom dimension consisting of attributes. A common use of this dimension is to describe data values which are reported by multiple partners in the same location for the same data element and time period. In principle, it can be used as a "free-form" dimension, to describe multiple observations of the same phenomena at the same place and time. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e406"></a>3.2.1.&nbsp;Data element categories</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The data element mentioned above ,"Measles doses given",  can be further  disaggregated into by combinations of data element categories. Each system administrator of DHIS 2 is free to define any data element category dimensions for data elements. There are however, certain best practices which should generally be followed.</p>
      <p>Given the example of Measles vaccination, if you want to know whether these vaccines were given at the facility (fixed) or out in the community as part of the outreach services then you could add a dimension called e.g. "Place of service" with the two possible options "Fixed" and "Outreach". Then all data collected on measles immunisation would have to be disaggregated along these to options. In addition to this you might be interested in knowing how many of these children who were under 1 year or  above 1 year of age. If so you can add an Age dimension to the data element with the two possible options "&lt;1 y" and "&gt;1 y". This implies further detail on the data collection process. You can also apply both categories "Place of service" and "Age" and combine these into a data element category combination e.g. called "EPI disaggregation". You would then be able to look at four different more detailed values in stead of only one as in the example above for the data element "Measles doses given": 1) "Fixed and &lt;1 y, 2) Fixed and &gt;1 y, 3) Outreach and &lt;1 y, and 4) Outreach and &gt;1 y. This adds complexity to how data is collected by the health facilities, but at the same time opens up for new possibilities of detailed data analysis of Measles immunisation.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e485"></a>3.2.2.&nbsp;Data element group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>While the data element categories and their options described above provide the level of detail (disaggregation) at the point of data collection and how data values get stored in the database, the data element group sets and groups can be used to add more information to data elements after data collection.  As an example,  if you are analyzing many data elements at the same time in a report, you would want to group these based on some criteria. Instead of looking at all the data captured in a form for immunisation and nutrition, you might want to separate or group data elements along a programme dimension (known as a data element group set in DHIS 2) where "Immunisation" (or EPI) and "Nutrition" would be the two groups. </p>
      <p>Expanding the report to include data from other programs or larger themes of health data would mean more groups to such a group set dimension, like "Malaria", "Reproductive Health", "Stocks". For this example, you would create a data element group set called "Programme" (or whatever name you find appropriate), and to represent the different programmes in this dimension  you would define data elements groups called "EPI", "Nutrition", "Malaria", "Reproductive health" and so on, and add all these groups to the "Programme" group set. To link or tag the data element "Measles doses given" to such a dimension you must (in our example) add it to the "EPI" group. Which groups you add "Measles doses given" to does not affect how health facilities collect the data, but adds more possibilities to your data analysis. So for the group set dimensions there are three levels; the group set (e.g. "Programme"), the group (e.g. "EPI"), and the data element (e.g. "Measles doses given").</p>
      <p>Indicators can be grouped into indicator groups and further into indicator group sets (dimensions) in exactly the same way as data elements.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e543"></a>3.3.&nbsp;The organisation unit dimension</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Organisation units in DHIS2 should typically represent a location, such as a Community Health Centre or referral hospitals, or an administrative unit like "MoHS Sierra Leone", "Bo District" or "Baoma Chiefdom". In non-health sector applications, they could be "schools" or "water points".   Orgunits are represented in a default hierarchy, usually the default administrative hierarchy of a country or region,  and are therefore assigned an organisational level. As an example, Sierra Leone has four organisation unit levels; National, District, Chiefdom, and PHU, and all orgunits are linked to one of these levels. An orgunit hierarchy in DHIS can have any number of levels. Normally data is collected at the lowest level, at the health facility, but can be collected at any level within the hiearchy, such as both the districts as well as the facility level. </p>
    <p>  When designing reports at higher levels with data aggregated at the district or province level,  DHIS 2 will use the hierarchy structure to aggregate all the health facilities' data for any given unit at any level. The organisation unit  level capturing the data always represents the lowest level of detail that is possible to use in data analysis, and the organisational levels define the available levels of aggregation along a geographical dimension.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e547"></a>3.3.1.&nbsp;Organisation unit group sets and groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>While facility level is typically the lowest geographical level for disaggregation in DHIS 2, there are ways to flexibly group organisation units into any number of dimensions by using the organisation unit groups and group set functionality.  As an example,  if all facilities are given an official type like "Community health center" or "District Hospital,  it is possible to create an organisation unit group set called "Type" and add groups with the names of the  types mentioned above.In order for the group sets to function properly in analysis, each organisation unit should be a member of a single group (compulsory and exclusive) within a group set. Stated somewhat differently, a facility should not be both a "Community health center" as well as a "District hospital". </p>

        <p>A more advanced use of organisation unit group sets  is to create alternative hierarchies e.g. use administrative borders from other ministries. In Sierra Leone that could mean an alternative hierarchy of 1:MoHS, 2:Districts, and 3: Local councils,  instead of the four-level hierarchy with  chiefdoms and PHUs. For instance, if all PHUs are  linked to a specific local council, it would be possible to look at data aggregated by local council instead of chiefdom. Then you would first need to create a group set called "Local council" and then create one orgunit group for every local council, and finally link all PHUs to their corresponding local council group.</p>

      <p>As mentioned above, all organisation units should be a member of a single group within a group set. If an organisation unit is not present in any group or is present in multiple group members in a group set, this can lead to unexpected results in the analysis modules. DHIS 2 has integrity checks to identify organisation units which are not present in any organisation unit group set member, or which is present in multiple groups.  </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e609"></a>3.4.&nbsp;The period dimension in DHIS2</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The period dimension becomes an important factor when analysing data over time e.g. when looking at cumulative data, when creating quarterly or annual aggregated reports, or when doing analysis that combines data with different characteristics like monthly routine data, annual census/population data or six-monthly staff data.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e612"></a>3.4.1.&nbsp;Period Types</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>In DHIS 2,  periods are organised according to a set of fixed period types described below. The following list is for the default ISO 8601 calendar type. </p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Daily</p>

        </li></ol></div>
      <p> 
</p>
      <p>As a general rule, all organisation units should collect the same data using the same frequency or periodicity. A data entry form therefore is associated with a single period type to make sure data is always collected according to the correct and same periodicity across the country. </p>
      <p>It is possible however to collect the same data elements using different period types by
        assigning the same data elements to multiple data sets with different period types, however
        then it becomes crucial to make sure no organisation unit is collecting data using both data
        sets/period types as that would create overlap and duplication of data values. If configured        correctly the aggregation service in DHIS2  will
        aggregate the data together, e.g. the monthly data from one part of the country with
        quarterly data from another part of the country into a national quarterly report. For
        simplicity and to avoid data duplication it is advised to use the same period type for
        all organisation units for the same data elements when possible. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e642"></a>3.4.2.&nbsp;Relative periods</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>In addition to the fixed period types described in the previous section, DHIS 2 also support relative periods for use in the analysis modules.</p>
      <p>When creating analytical resources within  DHIS 2  it is
        possible to make use of the relative periods functionality. The simplest scenario is when
        you want to design a monthly report that can be reused every month without having to make
        changes to the report template to accommodate for the changes in period. The relative period
        called "Last month"  allows for this, and the user can at the time of report generation
        through a report parameter select the month to use in the report. </p>
      <p>A slightly more advanced use case is  when you want to make a monthly summary report for immunisation and want to look at the data from the current (reporting) month together with a cumulative value for the year so far. The relative period called "This year" provides such a cumulative value relative to the reporting month selecting when running the report. Other relative periods are the last 3,6, or 12 months periods which are cumulative values calculated back from the selected reporting month. If you want to create a report with data aggregated by quarters (the ones that have passed so far in the year) you can select "Last four quarters". Other relative periods are described under the reporting table section of the manual. </p>

      <p>While data needs to be collected on a given frequency to standardise data collection and management, this does not put limitations on the period types that can be used in data analysis and reports. Just like data gets aggregated up the organisational hierarchy, data is also aggregated according to a period hierarchy, so you can create quarterly and annual reports based on data that is being collected on a Monthly basis. The defined period type for a data entry form (data set) defines the lowest level of period detail possible in a report.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e679"></a>3.4.3.1.&nbsp;Sum and average aggregation along the period dimension</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>When aggregating data on the period dimension there are two options for how the calculation is done, namely sum or averge. This otion is specified on a per data element in DHIS 2 through the use of the 'aggregation operator' attribute in the Add/Edit Data Elements dialog.

</p>
        <p>Most of the data collected on a routinely basis should be aggregated by summing up the months or weeks, for instance to create  a quarterly report on Measles immunisation one would sum  up the three monthly values for "Measles doses given". 

</p>
        <p>Other types of data that are more permanently valid over time like "Number of staff in the PHU" or an annual population estimate of "Population under 1 year" need to be aggregated differently. These values are static for all months as long as there are valid data. For example,  the "Estimated population under 1", calculated from the census data ,is the same for all months of a given year, or the number of nurses working in a given facility is the same for every month in the 6 months period the number is reported for. 

</p>
        <p>This difference becomes important when calculating an annual value for the
          indicator morbidity service burden for a facility. The monthly head-counts are summed up for the
          12 months to get the annual headcount, while the number of staff for the PHU is calculated
          as the average of the two 6-monthly values reported through the 6-monthly staff report. So
          in this example the data element "OPD headcount" would have the aggregation
          operator "SUM" and the data element "Number of staff" would have it
          set to "AVERAGE". </p>
        <p>Another important feature of average data elements is the validity period concept.
          Average data values are standing values for any period type within the borders of the
          period they are registered for. For example,  an annual population estimate following the calendar
          year, will have the same value for any period that falls within that year no matter what
          the period type. If the population under 1 for a given facility is 250 for the year of
          2015 that means that the value will be 250 for Jan-15, for Q3-15, for Week 12 of 2015 and
          for any period within 2015. This has implications for how  coverage indicators are
          calculated, as the full annual population will be used as denominator value even when doing
          monthly reports. If you want to look at an estimated annual coverage value for a given
          month, then you will have the option of setting the indicator to "Annualised"
          which means that a monthly coverage value will be multiplied by a factor of 12, a quarterly value by 4, in order to generate an effective yearly total. The annualised indicator feature can therefore be used to mimic the use of monthly
          population estimates. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e688"></a>3.5.1.&nbsp;Data collection and storage</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Datasets determine what raw data that is available in the system, as they describe how data is collected in terms of periodicity as well as spaital exten. Data sets  define the building blocks of the data to be captured and stored in DHIS 2. For each data dimension we decide what level of detail the data should be collected at namely 1) the data element (e.g. diagnosis, vaccine, or any event taking place) and its categories (e.g. age and gender), 2) the period/frequency dimension, and 3) the organisation unit dimension.  For any report or data analysis you can never retrieve more detailed data than what is defined in the data sets, so the design of the datasets and their corresponding data entry forms (the data collection tools) dictate what kind of data analysis will be possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e691"></a>3.5.2.&nbsp;Input does not equal Output</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>It is important to understand that the data entry forms or datasets themselves are not intrinsically  linked to the underlying data value and that  the meaning of data is only described by the data element (and its categories). This makes it perfectly safe to modify datasets and forms without altering the data (as long as the data elements stay the same). This loose coupling between forms and data makes DHIS 2  flexible when it comes to designing and changing new forms and in providing exactly the form the users want.   </p>
      <p>Another benefit of only linking data to data elements and not to forms, is the flexibility of creating indicators and validation rules based on data elements, and also in providing any kind of output report (in pivot tables, charts, maps etc) that can combine data individually or across forms, e.g. to correlate data from different health programs. Due to this flexibility of enabling integration of data from various programs (forms) and sources (routine and semi permanent (population, staff, equipment)) a DHIS database is used as an integrated data repository for many or all parts of the aggregated data in a larger HIS. The figure below illustrates this flexibility.</p>
      <p>

        </div><p>
</p>
      <p>In this example, we see that data elements from multiple forms can be combined to create a given indicator. As a more concrete example, one might collect "Population under one year of age" in an annual data set by district, and then collect a data element like "Fully immunized children" by month at the facility level. By annualizing the population, we can generate an approximation of the effective monthly population, and combining this with the aggregate total of the number of fully immunized children by month, it would be possible to generate an inidicator "Fully immunized coverage", consisting of the aggregated total of children who are fully immunized, divided by the effective monthly population. </p>

    <p>When doing data analysis in Excel pivot tables or any other OLAP based tool the dimensions become extremely powerful in providing many different views into the data. Each data element category or group set become a pivot field, and the options or groups become values within each of these fields. In fact categories and groupsets are treated exactly the same way in pivot tables, and so are orgunits, periods, and data elements. All these become dimensions to the data value that can be used to rearrange, pivot, filter, and to drill down into the data. Here we will show some examples of how the data dimensions are used in pivot tables.  </p>
    <p>Using the example of morbidity and mortality data, a pivot table can show how the  dimensions can be used to view data for different aggregation levels.

</p>
    <p>The completely aggregated number is viewed when none of the pivot fields are arranged in the table area, as column or row fields, but are listed above the table itself  as page field (filter).
</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_overview_1.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>Here we have selected to look at the Morbidity total. The various data elements on morbidity have been ordered into the main_de_groups Morbidity (we will get back to Mortality later). The fields above the table itself are all set to "All", meaning that the totals in the table will contain data from all Countries, Districts, Chiefdom, ou_type, year, months, the various categories as listed in the red fields, and all data elements in the Morbidity group.</p>
    <p>As we have seen, this is not a very useful representation, as Morbidity is organized into new cases, follow-ups, referrals, and then again in age groups. Also, we do not see the various diagnoses. The first step is to include the diagnoses field (which is a group set), which is done by dragging the "diagnosis" field down to be a row field, as shown in the figure below, and to add the group set called "morbiditymortality" in the column field to display new cases, follow-up, and referrals.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_diagnoses.jpg" align="middle" width="60"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>Contrast this figure above to the one below.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_dataelements.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>They both show the same data (some of the rows have been cut in the screenshot due to
      image size), albeit in a different way. </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>The "dataelement" field, used in the bottom figure, displays each diagnosis as three elements; one follow-up, one new, and one referrals. This is the way the data elements have been defined in DHIS, as this makes sense for aggregation. You would not like to aggregate follow-ups and new, thus these have not been made as categories, the whole point of is to ease aggregation and disaggregation.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The "diagnosis" group set has instead been made to lump these three (follow-up, new, referrals) together, which can then be split with another group set, namely the one called "morbiditymortality". This allows us to organize the data as in the first of the two figures, where we have the single diagnosis per row, and the groups new, follow-up, referrals as rows.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>The idea of using group sets is that you can combine, in any set, different data elements. Thus, if we add the mortality data (by checking it from the drop-down menu of the main_de_groups field, and moving this field out of the table) we can see also the deaths, since the mortality data elements have been included as a "death" group in the "morbiditymortality" group set. The result is shown below.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_diagnoses_all.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>The result is a much more user-friendly pivot table. Now, another figure shows the relationship between the group sets and elements (these are fake data values).</p>
    <p>

</p>
    <p>This small detail of the pivot table show how the actual data elements link to the group sets: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>The four data elements, as defined in DHIS, are Measles death, Measles follow-up, Measles new, and Measles referrals</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>They all belong to the group set "diagnosis", where they have been lumped together in the group Measles</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The group set "morbiditymortality" contains the groups New cases, Follow-up, Referrals, and Deaths.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Only the data element Measles deaths has data related to the group Deaths, thus this is where the data value (20) is shown, at the upper right corner. The same for Measles new; the value (224) is shown at the intersection of the data element Measles new and the group New cases (in the group set morbiditymortality)</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>All the intersections where the data element does not link with the groups in morbiditymortality are left blank. Thus in this case we would get a nice table if we excluded the dataelement from the table, and just had diagnosis and the group set morbiditymortality, as in the figure shown earlier</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Now lets see how the data element categories can be used. In the data entry form for
      Morbidity the new cases and follow-ups use one age category, the referral data another,, and
      the mortality data a third age breakup, so these are available as three individual age group
      fields in the pivot tables called morbidity_age, referrals_age and mortality_age. It doesn't
      make sense to use these while looking at these data together (as in the examples above), but
      e.g. if we only want to look at the only the new cases we can put the MobidityMortalityGroups
      field back up as a page field and there select the New cases group as a filter. Then we can
      drag the Morbidity_age field down to the column area and we get the following view:</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_morb_age.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
    <p>The following table illustrates the benefits of reusing data element categories across
      datasets and categorycombinations. The VCCT, ART and PMTCT data are collected in three
      different datasets, the first two with both gender and age breakdown, and the PMTCT only age
      (gender is given). All three share the same age groups and therefore it is possible to view
      data elements from all these three datasets in the same table and use the age dimension. In
      the previous example with morbidity and mortality data this was not possible since new cases,
      referrals and deaths all have different age groups.</p>

      </div><p>  </p>
    <p>In the table below PMTCT data has been removed from the table and the gender category added to the column area so that you can analyse the data for VCCT and ART by age and gender. An optional subtotal for gender has also been  added, as well as a grand total for all age and gender.</p>

    <p>Typically the design of a DHIS 2 dataset is based on some requirements from a paper form that is already in use. The logic of paper forms are not the same as the data element and data set model of DHIS, e.g. often a field in a tabular paper form is described both by column headings and text on each row, and sometimes also with some introductory table heading that provides more context. In the database this is captured in one atomic data element with no reference to a position in a visual table format, so it is important to make sure the data element with the optional data element categories capture the full meaning of each individual field in the paper form. </p>
    <p>Another important thing to have in mind while designing datasets is that the dataset and the corresponding data entry form (which is a dataset with layout) is a data collection tool and not  a report or analysis tool. There are other far more sophisticated tools for data output and reporting in DHIS than the data entry forms. Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values), repetition of annual data (the same population data reported every month) or even indicator values such as coverage rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in DHIS every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated values such as the ones mentioned above. You only want to capture the raw data in your datasets/forms and leave the calculations to the computer, and presentation of such  values to the reporting tools in DHIS.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e789"></a>3.8.1.&nbsp;From tables to category combinations - designing multi-dimensional data sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>As we have seen in the examples above,  data element categories and category options are helpful in representing tabular data, when adding dimensions to a field in a paper form. We have also seen how the data element is one of the required dimensions which describe data in DHIS 2. As we will see in the example below there are often more than one way to represent a paper form in DHIS 2 , and it can be difficult to know which dimension to represent with a data element name and which to represent as categories, or even as groups as we have seen above. Here are some general lessons learned from working with data element and category combinations:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Design your dimensions with data use in mind, not data collection. This means that disaggregation of data values at collection time should be easily aggregated up along the various dimensions, as in adding up to a meaningful total.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Reuse dimensions as much as possible as this increases the ability to compare disaggregated data (e.g. age groups, fixed/outreach, gender). </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Disaggregation dimensions should add up to a total. In certain cases, data elements may be collected a subsets of each other. In this case, use of categories to disaggregate the data element should not be used. As an example, we might collect "Number of confirmed malaria cases" and disaggregate this by "Under 5" and "Over 5". A third data element "Number of confirmed malaria cases under 1" might also exist on the form. It would seem reasonable then to create three age groups : Under 1, Under 5 and Over 5, to describe the disaggregation. However, the Under 1 is actually a subset of the Under 5 group, and when totaled, would result in duplication. Thus, categories should be generally be composed of mutually exclusive category options, such that the sum of individual category options results in a coherent total. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Different levels of dimensions; 1) disaggregation and 2) grouping. Disaggregation dimensions dictate how you collect and how detailed you store your data, so plan these carefully. The group dimension is more flexible and can be changed and added to even after data collection (think of it as tagging). </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>It is best to think of how the data would be used in an integrated data repository and not how it will actually be collected on forms or  by programs when designing the meta-data model. Ideally, the same type of disaggregation should be used across forms and datasets for data elements which will be analysed together, or used to build indicators. Reuse definitions so that the database can integrate even though the forms themselves might be duplicated (which in practice, is often the case). </p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>In order to better explain the approach and the possibilities we present an example paper form and will walk through it step by step and design data elements, categories, category options and category combinations.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
          <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/PHUF3.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div><p> </p>
      <p>This form has many tables and each of them potentially represent a data element category combination (from now on referred to as a catcombo). As such there is no restriction on a dataset to only have one set of dimensions or catcombo, it can have many and as we see above this is necessary as the dimensions are very different from table to table. In the following paragraphs, we will analyze how to break down this form into its compoenent pieces and suggest an implementation pathway in DHIS 2. </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>ANC table</strong></span>. This table in the top left corner is one the simpler ones in this form. It has two dimensions, the first column with the ANC activity or service (1st visit, IPT 2nd dose etc) and the second and third column which represent the place where the service was given with the two options "Fixed" and "Outreach". Since the ANC service is the key phenomena to analyse here, and often there is a need for looking at the total of "ANC 1st visits" no matter where they actually took placed,  it makes a lot of sense to use this dimension as the data element dimension.</p>
      <p>Thus, all items on the first column from "1st ANC" visit to "2nd IPT dose given by TBA" are represented as individual data elements. The "where" dimension is represented as a data element category (from now on referred to as category) with the name "fixed/outreach" with the two data element category options (from now on catoptions) "fixed" and "outreach". There is no other dimension here so we add a new catcombo with the name "Fixed/Outreach" with one category "Fixed/Outreach". Strictly speaking there is another dimension in this table, and that is the at PHU or by TBA dimension which is repeated for the two doses of IPT, but since none of the other ANC services listed have this dimension it does not seem like a good idea to separate out two data elements from this table and give them another catcombo with both fixed/outreach and at PHU/by TBA. reusing the same catcombo for all the ANC services makes more sense since it will be easier to look at these together in reports etc. and also the fact that there is not much to lose by repeating the at PHU or by TBA information as part of the data element name when it is only for four data elements in a table of eleven  data elements.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>DELIVERY table.</strong></span> This table is more tricky as it has a
        lot of information and you can see that not all the rows have the same columns (some columns
        are merged and a one field is grayed out/disabled.). If we start by looking at the first
        column "Deliveries assisted by" that seems to be one dimension, but only down to
        the "Untrained TBA" row, as the remaining three rows are not related to who
        assisted the delivery at all. Another dimension is the place of delivery, either In PHU or
        in Community as stated on the top column headings. These deliveries are further split into
        the outcome of the delivery, whether it is a live or still birth, which seems to be another
        dimension. So if we disregard the three bottom rows for a moment there seems to be 3
        dimensions here, 1) assisted by, 2) place of delivery, and 3) delivery outcome. The key
        decision to make is what to use as the data element, the main dimension, the total that you
        will most often use and want easily available in reports and data analysis. </p>
      <p>In this case,  the outcome dimension  as "Total live births" is a very commonly used value in many
        indicators (maternal mortality ratio, births attended by skilled health personnel etc.). In
        this case the "Assisted By" dimension could also have been used without any problem, but the
        added value of easily getting the total live births information was the decisive point for
        us. This means that from this table (or sub-table of row 1 to 6) there are only two data
        elements; "Live births" and "Still births". </p>
      <p>Next, there are two more
        dimensions, the "PHU/Community" with its two options and a "Births attended
        by" with options ("MCH Aides", "SECHN", "Midwives",
        "CHO", "Trained TBA", "Untrained TBA"). These two categories
        make up the catcombo "Births" which is assigned to the two data elements
        "Live births" and "Still births". Considering the final three rows of
        the delivery table we can see that "Complicated Deliveries" does not have the
        assisted by dimension, but has the place and the outcome. "Low birth weight" also
        does not have the assisted by dimension and not the outcome either. The LLITN given after
        delivery does not have any additional dimension at all. Since not any of the three rows can
        share catcombo with any other row we decided to represent these fields as so called flat
        data elements, meaning data elements with no categories at all, and simply adding the
        additional information from the column headings to the data element name, and therefore
        ended up with the following data elements with the default (same as none) catcombo;
        "Complicated deliveries in PHU live birth", "Complicated deliveries in PHU
        still births", "Complicated deliveries in community live birth",
        "Complicated deliveries in community still births", "Low birth weight in
        PHU", "Low birth weight in community", and "LLITN given after
        delivery".</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>POST-NATAL CARE table</strong></span> This table is simple and we used the same approach as for the ANC table. 3 data elements listed in the first column and then link these to the catcombo called "fixed/outreach". Reusing the same category fixed/outreach for these data elements enables analysis on fixed/outreach together with ANC data and other data using the same category.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>TT table</strong></span> This table is somewhat more complex than the previous examples.We decided to use
        "TT1", "TT2" ... "TT5" as data elements which makes it easy to
        get the total of each one of these. There is fixed/outreach dimension here, but there is
        also the "In school place" that is only applied to the Non-Pregnant, or more correctly to any
        of the two as the school immunisation is done whether the girls are pregnant or not. We
        consulted the program people behind the form and found out that it would be OK to register
        all school TT immunisations as non-pregnant, which simplifies the model a bit since we can
        reuse the "TT1" to "TT5" data elements. So we ended up with a new
        category called "TT place" with the three options (Fixed, Outreach, In School),
        and another category called "Pregnant/Non-pregnant" with two options. The new
        catcombo "TT" is then a combination of these two and applied to the 5 TT data
        elements. Since we agreed to put all In Schools immunisations under Non-pregnant in means
        that the combination of options (Pregnant+In School) will never be used in any data entry
        form, and hence become a possible optioncombo, which is OK. As long as the form is custom
        designed then you can choose which combinations of options to use or not, and therefore it
        is not a problem to have such passive or unused catoptions. Having school as one option in
        the TT place category simplifies the model and therefore we thought it was worth it. The
        alternative would be to create 5 more data elements for "TT1 in school" ...
        "TT5 in school", but then it would be a bit confusing to add these together with
        the "TT1" ..."TT5" plus TT catcombo. Having school as a place in the TT
        place category makes it a lot easier to get the total of TT1.. TT5 vaccines given, which are
        the most important numbers and most often used values for data analysis.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Complications of early and late pregnancy and labour tables</strong></span> We treat these two tables as one, and will explain why. These two tables
        are a bit confusing and not the best design. The most important  data coming out of these tables are
        the pregnancy complications and the maternal deaths. These data elements contain  further detail on the cause of the complication or death (the
        first column in both tables), as well as a place of death (in PHU or community), and an
        outcome of the complication (when its not a death) that can be either "Managed at PHU" or
"       Referred". We decided to create two data elements for these two tables; "Pregnancy
        complications", and "Maternal Deaths", and two category combinations, one for
        each of the data elements. For the Pregnancy Complications data element there are two
        additional dimensions, the cause of the complication (the combined list of the first column
        in the two tables) and the outcome (managed at PHU or Referred), so these are the categories
        and options that make up that category combination. For the "Maternal deaths" data
        element the same category with the different causes are used and then another category for
        the place of death (in PHU or In community). This way the two data elements can share one
        category and it will be easy to derive the total number of pregnancy complications and
        maternal deaths. While the list of complications on the paper form is divided into two
        (early and late/labour) you can see that e.g. the malaria in 2nd and 3rd trimester are
        listed under early, but in fact are for a later phase of the pregnancy. There is no clear
        divide between early and late complications in the form, and therefore we gave up trying to
        make this distinction in the database. </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Family Planning Services table</strong></span> This table has 2 dimensions, the family planning method (contraceptive) and whether the client is new or continuing. We ended up with one data element only "Family planning clients" and then added two categories "FP method" with all the contraceptives as options, and another category "FP client type" with new or continuing as options. This way it will be easy to get the total number of family planning clients which is the major value to look at in data analysis, and from there you can easily get the details on method or how many new clients there are.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ou_hierarchy"></a>4.1.&nbsp;The organisational hierarchy</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation structure of the DHIS2 instance, such as how  the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas are arranged with respect to each other. It is essentially the "where" dimension of DHIS2, similar to how periods represent the "when" or time dimension. DHIS2 is structured so that the organisational unit hierarchy is a geographical hierarchy, and the GIS module depends on this. Non-geographical hierarchies are discouraged, and would better to be represented through the use of organisational unit groups. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health or a country) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in DHIS2. </p>
    <p>The design of this hierarchy will determine the  geographical units of analysis available to the users  as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. </p>
    <p>Additional  hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative boundaries to the health care sector) can be modeled using organisational groups and group sets, but the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. </p>
    <p>The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations. For instance a country  might have eight provinces, and each province again  might have a number of districts as their children. Normally the health facilities (from which data is typically collected)  will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </p>
    <p>Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g.  splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. </p>
    <div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Important"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="resources/images/admon/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
      <p>Because the most recent information which is contained in the organisational unit hierarchy is always used for aggregation, it is important to keep in mind that changes to it (such as the division of districts into two separate districts) will not be respected over time. As an example, District A may be sub-divided into District B and District C. This is a process which often happens for political reasons. Facilities which belong to District A would need to be reassigned to District B and C. However, any historical data, which was entered before the split actually occurred, would still be registered as belonging to District B and C and not the defunct District A. This temporal representation of the organisational hierarchy across time will be lost. </p>

      <p>This is where you can create organisation units (from now on referred to as orgunits) and build up the orgunit hierarchy. Orgunits are added one by one as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current organisational hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in the main list of orgunits in the middle of the screen. When an orgunit is selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate an orgunit in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the orgunit name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To add a new orgunit first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in the top right corner of the list of orgunits. To add a new root orgunit make sure no orgunit is selected in the menu and click on "Add new". The details of adding a new orgunit are explained in <a class="xref" href="#editOrganisationalUnits">Section&nbsp;4.2.1.1, &#8220;Editing organisation units&#8221;</a>. </p>

        <p>To edit the properties of an existing orgunit first select its parent (if any) in the left side menu, then locate the orgunit in the listed orgunits, and  click on  the  name of the orgunit that you want to modify. A context menu will appear, and you should select "Edit". Refer to the screen-shot below to see how it works. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ou_groupsets"></a>4.2.2.&nbsp;Organisation unit group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to orgunits. Any number of group sets can be added, but as a default start all databases will have the two group sets "Type" and "Ownership". Using these  group sets will simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel PivotTables.</p>
      <p>While a group set like "Type" describes a measure dimension, the actual
        categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an orgunit through the
        orgunit's group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel hierarchy of orgunits
        with the group set as the root ("Type"), the groups at level 2 (e.g.
        "Clinic", "Hospital", "Dispensary"), and the actual orgunits
        at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information and dimensionality to
        the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated by groups within a
        group set. </p>
      <p>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary. A group set is always exclusive, which means that an orgunit cannot be member of more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new organisational unit, you will only be allowed to select a single organisational group membership for each group set. Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means that ALL orgunits must be member of a group in that group set. </p>
      <p>We recommend that you approach the orgunit grouping in the following sequence (and one group set at a time):</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Define a new group set, such as "Location". </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Add new  groups  (such as "Urban", "Rural" and "Peri-urban"). Once all groups have been defined, return to the organisational unit group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the orgunits that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple organisation units at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the same organisational units in two groups which itself is a member of an organisation unit group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have organisation unit groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>A better way to ensure that you do not mistakenly assign an organisation unit to
            multiple members of a group set is you can use the edit feature of each organisational
            unit to assign memberships to each group set. You will only be able to assign a single
            organisation unit at a time however.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>It is important to keep in mind when using the "Organisational unit group" set function, that unless great care is taken, organisational units can be assigned to multiple groups of a group set. This can be checked through the "Data Integrity" module, which will report which organisational units are not members of a compulsory organisational unit group set, and which organisational units have been assigned to more than one member of a group set. </p>

        <p>Click on the name of the organisation unit group set you wish to modify, followed by "Edit" from the context menu which will appear.  The following properties can be defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Compulsory: Indicate whether ALL orgunits need to be member of a group in this group set or not.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Available groups/Selected groups: Here you assign groups to your group set by using the arrow buttons to move  highlighted groups between the two lists (/selected). If no groups appear in the  list then you must go to orgunit groups and create new groups there first. Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an orgunit that again is already member of a group that has already  been selected by this group set, will not be possible since one orgunit will end up with two group memberships in the same group set. To avoid such situations we recommend first adding groups to group sets, and then orgunits to groups.</p>

    <p>Data elements form the basis of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in system, e.g. number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria. The actual creation and definition of the data elements themselves are far beyond the scope of this manual to describe, but it is assumed that an administrator will be provided with a list of standardised data elements for inclusion into the DHIS2 system. </p>
    <p>To access the data elements app, Apps- &gt; Data Elements / Indicators - &gt; Data Elements. </p>
    <p>The 'Search by name' will allow you to filter a range of data elements if you know either the full name of the data element, or just a part of it. Type the name
               into the search field and any matching data elements are displayed below.

    <p>Data element groups provide a mechanism for classifying related data elements into a common theme. For instance, two data elements "Measles immunisation" and  "BCG Immunisation" might be grouped together into a data element group "Childhood immunisation". To access the data element group maintenance page, click Apps -&gt; Data elements / Indicators -&gt; Data Element Group.</p>
    <p>Similar to the "Data element" maintenance page, data elements groups can be searched with by entering a search string in the "Search by name" field. </p>

    <p>The data element group editor provides advanced functionality to the administrator to allow multiple data elements to be added or removed from a group. It is also possible to create new data element groups, rename existing groups, and delete groups entirely. To access the data element group editor, go to <span class="guimenu">"Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and Indicators -&gt; Data Element Group Editor"</span>. The following screen will appear.</p>

    <p>Data element group sets allow multiple data element groups to be categorised into a set. Data element group sets are used during analysis and reporting to combine similar data element groups into a common theme. To access the data element group set maintenance module, choose "Apps -&gt; Data elements /  Indicators -&gt; Data Element Group Set".  Similar to the other data element maintenance modules, new data element group sets can be added by pressing the "+".  Other operations include Edit, Clone, Share, Delete and Show details, similar to data elements and data element groups as described in the previous sections.</p>
    <p>Existing data element group  set members can be edited by right-clicking the name  and selecting "Edit" from the context menu of the desired data element group set as seen below.</p>

    <p>Categories can be used to disaggregate data elements into individual atomic components. They can also be used to assign attributes to all data recorded in a specific dataset, such as "Implementing partner" and "Funding agency." </p>
    <p> Data element categories are typically a concept, such as Gender, Age or  Disease Status. Data elements such as "Number of cases of confirmed malaria" are often broken into smaller component parts to determine, for instance, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups. As an example, three data element categories: Under 1, 1-5 and Over 5 could be created. They could be assigned as categories to the data element, which would then create in the data entry screens, three separate fields for this data element namely: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

    <p>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the DHIS2 system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately. Judicious use of data element categories will greatly simplify the DHIS2 implementation, and allow for subsequent advanced analysis. </p>
    <p>Where possible, category options should be recycled. For instance, there might be two categories which might share a particular category option (e.g. &lt;1 year of age). When creating the  categories, this category option could be reused. This is important if particular category options (or category option combinations) need to be analyzed together. </p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p> All possible category options should be defined.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Categories should be composed of multiple category options created in Step 1. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

      </li><li class="listitem">

      </li></ol></div>
    <p>A  category option consists of a name, along with an optional code, and a concept. </p>
    <p>Categories can be added by accessing "Category Option" from the Data elements / Indicators App.  The category option must consist of a name, and short name at minimum. </p>
    <p>Once all category options have been defined for a particular category, the category can be defined with the "Data Element Category Management" dialog.  Add a new data element category by clicking on the "+" icon. You can also edit existing categories by right-clicking and selecting edit from the contextual menu.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/data_element_categories_add_new.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>Type the name of the new data element category in the "Name" field.  Category options can be added by moving category options from the left-side pane (Available category options) into the right-side pane(Selected category options). Once all data element categories options have been added to the data element category, press the <span class="guibutton">"Save"</span> button to save all changes or the <span class="guibutton">"Cancel"</span>  button to discard any changes.</p>
    <p>A  category can have two types "Disaggregation" or "Attribute". For disaggregation of data elements, you should select "Disaggregation".  A dimension type of "Attribute" will allow the category to be used to assign a combination of categories to data recorded through a dataset.</p>
    <p>If the "Use as data dimension" box is ticked, the category will be available to the analytics as another dimension, in addition to the standard dimensions of "Period" and "Organisation unit". </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataElementCategoryCombo"></a>5.6.&nbsp;Category combinations</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Category combinations allow multiple categories to be combined into a related set. As an example, a data element "Number of new HIV infections" might be disaggregated according to the following categories. </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>HIV Service: "Other", "PMTCT", TB</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Gender: Male, Female</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p> In this example, there would be two levels of disaggregation, consisting of two separate data element categories, each consisting of several data element category options. In most HMIS systems, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By combining these different categories into a category combination and assigning these combinations to data elements, the appropriate disaggregation levels can be applied efficiently and quickly to a large number of data elements. </p>
    <p>To access the  category combination maintenance module, select "Apps -&gt; Data Elements / Indicators -&gt; Category combination" from the main DHIS2 menu. As with the  other maintenance  modules, you can filter the listed category combinations by entering the name (or portion thereof) of the category combination. Other operations such as "Edit", "Delete" and "Show details" should be familiar to the reader. </p>
    <p>To add a new category combination, click the "+" button. The following will be displayed. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/data_element_category_combo_add_new.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>Type the name of the category combination in the "Name" field, and then select the desired categories from the left panel. Press the "-&gt;" button to add the selected categories to the category combination. Press "&lt;-" to remove any categories that should not be part of the category combination. </p>
    <p>Categories can only be added to a category combination at this step. Categories can be removed from category combinations later by editing the category combination, however, it is not allowed to add additional categories once the combination has been created. Ensure that the category combination and its respective categories is final before you create the category combination and assign it to a data element. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1195"></a>5.7.&nbsp;Using category combinations as attributes</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>In some deployments of DHIS2, information on attributes such as "Implementing partner" and "Project" are important to record as an attribute of each data value. To provide an example, let us suppose that an NGO is providing ART services in a given facility. They would need to report each month on the "ART monthly summary", which would be reported monthly and contain a number of data elements.  The NGO and project could potentially change over time. In order to be able to effectively attribute data to a given NGO and project at any point in time, this information would need to be recorded along with each data value at the time of data entry. </p>
    <p>When categories and category combinations have a type of "Attribute", they can serve as a means of applying a common set of attributes (e.g. Implementing partner and project) to a related set of data values contained in a dataset. Let us suppose we create two categories called "Implementing partner" and "Projects". Each of these categories would be created with a dimension type of "Attribute."   Finally, a category combination called "Implementing partners and projects" would be created with these two categories and assigned a dimension type of "Attribute". Finally, we can use this dimension to apply an attribute to the dataset "ART monthly summary", by choosing  the "Implementing partners and projects" as the "Combination of categories". </p>
    <p>The following screen shot of an example data entry screen illustrates all of these concepts. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/categories_dataset_attributes.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>Note that when data is entered, an "Implementing partner" and "Project" can be selected. Each data value recorded in this data entry screen, would be assigned a specific combination of these categories as an attribute. These attributes (when specified as a dimension) can be used in the analysis modules similar to other dimensions, such as the period and orgunit.  In summary, when category combinations are used as attribute, they effectively serve as another dimension (similar to "Period" and "Organisationion unit") which can be used for analysis. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1205"></a>5.8.&nbsp;Category option combination maintenance</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Category option combinations can be assigned a code, which allows for easier data exchange between DHIS2 and external systems. Simply select the category option combination from the list, and provide the code. Note that all codes of category option combinations must be unique. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1208"></a>5.9.&nbsp;Category option groups and group sets</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Category options can be groups and classified using category option groups. Category
        option groups can be created from "Category option group" -&gt; "+", and contains a set of
        category options.</p>
    <p>Category option groups can be included in category option group sets. Category option
        group sets can be created from "Category option group set" -&gt; "+", and contains a set
        of category option groups.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the these entities is to be able to add more dimensionality to your
        captured data for analysis in apps such as pivot table and data visualizer. An example of
        where this becomes useful: In a system, data is collected by "projects", where projects is
        modeled as category options. The system is required to do data analysis according to which
        donor supports the project. In this case, a category option group set called "Donor" can be
        created. Each donor can be created as a category option group, where each category option /
        project is put in the appropriate group. In data analysis apps, the "Donor" group set will
        appear as a data dimension, while each donor appear as dimension items, ready for inclusion
        in reports.</p>

    <p>All data entry in DHIS2 is organised through the use of data sets. You can add and edit
      data sets by selecting the Data Sets App. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped
      together for data collection and data export between instances of DHIS2 (e.g. from a district
      office local installation to a national server). </p>
    <p>A data set has a data collection frequency which can be set through the period type
      property. The frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly.
      Which data elements to include in the data set and the frequency are set in the Add/Edit Data
      set window. In order to use a data set to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign
      the orgunit to the data set, and this mechanism controls which org units that can use which
      data sets. </p>
    <p>Data sets also are assigned to specific organisation units which will be allowed to enter
      data for all data elements in that data set. You can assign org units to a data set in the
      Data set management by clicking on the blue folder icon, the first icon under Operations, next
      to the data set you would like to modify. Alternatively you can manage orgunit assignments for
      all data sets together in the Data set Assignment Editor (available in the right-side menu). </p>
    <p>A data set has several properties that must be entered when creating a new one. Name,
      short name, code and description should be used to identify and describe the data set. The
      other properties deserve an explanation:</p>

          number of days has expired, the data set will be locked for further entry. You can set

      <p>Before reading this section it is recommended to familiarize oneself with the sections
        on categories in the data element chapter. Whereas data element categories can be used for
        capturing disaggregations of data elements, data set categories are used to capture
        information which is common to an entire form.</p>
      <p>To set up categories for data set, start by creating category options, categories and
        category combinations like described in the data element chapter. Make sure that you set the
        type of categories and category combinations to "Attribute". To assign a category
        combination to a data set, you can select it while creating or updating the data set from
        the "Combination of categories" drop-down box.</p>
      <p>When a data set is linked to a category combination, those categories will be displayed
        as drop-down boxes in the data entry module. Data captured in the form will then be linked
        to the selected category options from those drop-down boxes.</p>
      <p>An scenario for when data set categories are useful is when you need to capture a data
        entry form for a implementing partner organisation and a project. In that case, start by
        creating category options and categories for all partner organisations and projects, before
        linking these in a new category combination. Then, link the category combination to the data
        set (form) for which you need to capture this information. When opening this data set in
        data entry module, the partner organisation and project categories will automatically be
        rendered as drop-down boxes, allowing you to select a specific implementing partner
        organisation and project before continuing to do data entry.</p>

    <p>Once you have assigned a data set to an orgunit that data set will be made available in
      Data Entry for the orgunits you have assigned it to.  A default data entry form will then be
      shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a
      column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with a non-default
      categorycombination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be
      automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions. </p>
    <p>If you use more than one dataelement category combination you will get multiple columns in the data entry form with different column headings for the options. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1318"></a>6.2.1.&nbsp;Section forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and
        are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with
        subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table, both of
        these functions are supported in section forms. This function can be accessed by choosing
        selecting the dataset and choosing the "View sections" option from the context menu.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataSetSection"></a>6.2.2.&nbsp;Adding a new section form</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Section forms are separated automatically by data element category combinations, which produce a spreadsheet like data entry form for each section. </p>
      <p>When designing a section form the procedure is as follows:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p> Set up your data set as described in <a class="xref" href="#datasets" title="6.1.&nbsp;Data sets">Section&nbsp;6.1, &#8220;Data sets&#8221;</a></p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Open the Data Set Section window by selecting your data set followed by the "View sections" option from the context menu. To add a new section to a section form choose the specific category combo
            and press "Add new". You can now add data elements from the "Available
            data element" list on the left to the "Selected data elements" list on
            the right. Data elements can be sorted within the section with the use of the "Move
            up" <img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_up.png"> and
            "Move down" <img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_down.png"> buttons. Be sure to press
            "Save" once you have finished.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">

            </td></tr></table></div>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p> You may need to control how the data element sections are displayed on the final
            form. In the Data set Section management,  leave [All] in the "Select Category Combo" drop-down.
            Click on "Sort section" to sort the order of appearance of your sections in
            the data entry form.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>In Data Entry you can now start using the Section form (which will appear automatically
            when sections are available for the selected data set). Data sets which have section
            forms will automatically display the section form.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Certain data elements may need to be disabled for data entry. Within Data set section management, choose the section which contains these data elements and select Section grey field management from the context window.  Pressing the "Disable" button will prevent data from being entered into this specific data element/category option during data entry. Be sure to press "Done" to save your changes.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/datasets/sectionform_grey_field_management.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

      <p>A sample section form is displayed in the next figure. Notice how each data element
        category has been separated into a separate section, and a data entry table has been
        automatically generated by the system. Use of section forms in combination with data element
        categories can drastically reduce the amount of time which is required to create data entry
        forms for data sets.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="customDataEntryForm"></a>6.2.3.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>When the form you want to design is to complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. DHIS2 uses a built-in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly (using the Source window in the editor). A complete reference for use of the editor can be found <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the big advantages of custom forms, is that they can be created to mimic existing paper aggregation forms. This makes data entry much easier for users, and should reduce the number of data elements which are incorrectly entered, as they are more easily identifiable when entering data from a paper form. </p>
      <p>Once a custom form has been added to a data set it will be available in data entry and
        used automatically. </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>Custom forms are preferentially displayed over section forms. If a data set has both a
          section form and a custom form, the custom form will be displayed during data entry. Users
          will not be able to select which method they wish to input data, so be sure that your
          custom form contains all data elements which may be required. However, if using a mobile interface, sections forms will display preferentially over custom forms; therefore both can be used to support data collection depending on the method of data entry. </p>
      </td></tr></table></div>
      <p>To add a custom form design to a data set then first locate your data set in the Data
        set Management window and click on the Design data entry form from the context menu.</p>
      <p>First provide a Name for the form. There are a few important buttons in the Editor that you must pay special attention to. The icon with four outward arrows is the full screen mode on/off button, which can be very useful. The there is a Source button that shows the HTML code for your form. </p>
      <p>If you already have the HTML for your form then you should start by pasting it in here. Click on Source again to go back to preview/non-HTML mode. A blue icon under the editor window, "Insert data elements," allows you to add data elements to the form.</p>
      <p>All the input fields need to have a link to a data element or indicator. To add new data elements to the form, double-click them from the data element/indicator box as shown below. You can also select a data element/indicator and press the "+Insert" button. You can switch between either data elements, totals for  or indicators by pressing the respective buttons.</p>

      <p>In custom data entry form you can use javascript to create dynamic behavior and
        customziations. The DHIS 2 data entry module provides a range of events which you can
        register for and use to perform actions at certain times. The events are registered on the
        document element. The jQuery event object and the data set identifier are always the first
        two arguments provided to the callback functions. The table below provides an overview of
        the events and when they are triggered.</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e1372"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;Data entry events</b></p><div class="table-contents">

      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>To register for such an event:</p>
      <pre class="screen">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.formReady', function( event, ds ) {
  console.log( 'The form with id: ' + ds + ' is loaded!' );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.dataValueSaved', function( event, ds, dv ) {
  console.log( 'Data value: ' + dv.value + ' was saved with data element: ' + dv.de );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.completed', function( event, ds, cr ) {
  console.log( 'Form was completed for org unit: ' + cr.ou );
} );

&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      <p>Be careful to only use "namespaced" events like the ones in the example above and not
        general ones like "click" as the dhis2.util.on method will unregister the event
        first.</p>
      <p>If your function only applies to certain data sets you can use the supplied data set
        identifier and shortcut your function for unwanted data sets like this:</p>
      <pre class="screen">dhis2.de.on( 'dhis2.de.event.validationSuccess', function( event, ds ) {
  if ( $.inArray( ds, ['utXOiGbEj14', 'Re7qzHEThSC'] ) == -1 ) {
    return false;
  }
  console.log( 'Form with id: ' + ds + ' validated successfully!' );
} );</pre>
      <p>The identifiers of the input fields in the data entry form is on the format described
        below. This format can be used to select the input fields in your script and perform actions
        on them:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;dataelementid&gt;-&lt;optioncomboid&gt;-val</pre>
      <p>Since the data set identifier is provided for all events a feasible alternative is to
        utilize the "files" Web API resource and keep your callback functions in a single file,
        where you let the javascript code take action based on which data set is currently
        loaded.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataSetAssignmentEditor"></a>6.2.5.&nbsp;Data set assignment editor</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The data set assignment editor is a tool for adding and removing many data sets to organisation units in batch style. Start by selecting an organisation unit from the selection tree. In the area below the tree a grid will be displayed showing all data sets as columns and the child organisation units as rows.</p>
      <p>From the grid you can now assign or unassign data sets simply by clicking on of the corresponding icons in the grid. If you want to assign or unassign an organisation unit to all data sets you can check or uncheck the checkbox next to the organisation unit. Your changes will automatically be saved.</p>

  <p>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</p>

    <p>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose <span class="italic">Users</span> from the "Apps" menu and then click "User" from the menu items on the left-hand pane.</p>

      <p>DHIS 2 supports a concept for user management referred to as <span class="italic">managed users</span> which which allows to explicitly define which users should be
        allowed to manage or modify which users. To "manage a user" implies that you can see and
        modify that user. The basic concept for user management is that you can see and modify users
        which you have been granted all of the authorities; in other words you can modify users
        which have a subset of your own authorities. The managed users concept gives you greater
        control over this.</p>
      <p>The managed users concept allows you to define which users should be able to manage
        which users. This is configured through user groups and memberships within such groups. A
        user group can be configured to be allowed to manage other user groups from the standard add
        and update user interface. The effect is that a specific user can manage all users which are
        members of user groups which can be managed by a user group that the user is member of. In
        other words, users can be managed by all members of user groups which are managing user
        groups they are member of.</p>
      <p>To enable this concept you should grant users the authority to "Add/update users within
        managed groups", and <span class="italic">not</span> grant access to the standard
        "Add/update users" authority. An implication of the managed users concept is that when
        creating a user with the "Add/update users within managed groups" only, the user must be
        made a member of at least one user group that the current user can manage. If not, the
        current user would lose access to the user being created immediately. This is validated by
        the system.</p>
      <p>When granted the "Add/update users within managed groups" authority, the
        system lets a user add members to user groups for which she has read-only access to. The
        purpose of this is to allow for desentralized user management. You may define a range of
        user groups where other users may add or remove members, but not remove or change the name
        of the group.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1565"></a>7.1.6.&nbsp;OpenID Support</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 supports the OpenID standard, which allows third party login using a OpenID
        provider, please see <a class="ulink" href="http://openid.net" target="_top">http://openid.net</a> for more
        information. To create a custom OpenID URL for a username you can visit this URL and log in
        with your OpenID provider: <a class="ulink" href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com" target="_top">http://openid-provider.appspot.com</a>.</p>
      <p>To enable support for this in DHIS 2, two steps must be done:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Set your OpenID provider</strong></span>: This can be done inside

  <p>This chapter discusses the sharing of entities feature in DHIS 2.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1582"></a>8.1.&nbsp;Sharing of objects</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Many objects in DHIS 2, like reports, charts, maps and indicators, can be
      shared. Sharing means making an object, like a report, available for reading or modification
      to a group of users or to everyone. For instance for reports, the sharing dialog can be opened
      by clicking on the "Sharing settings" button next to each report in the list. Implementers can use this feature to allow access to certain objects to only certain user groups. Users can use the feature to decide who they would like to share objects (such as pivot tables, charts, dashboards, etc) with. </p>
    <p>If sharing is supported for a particular class of objects, a dialog will be available called "Sharing settings", usually available by clicking on the name of the object or in the analytics tools, through an icon (Share with other people). Once you have accessed the sharing settings for the object you wish to share, a dialog similar to the one below will be shown. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/sharing/sharing-dialog.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>You can share your report with everyone or with a number of user groups. "External access" can be enabled to allow this resource to be shared with everyone, including users which cannot logon to DHIS2. This is useful for sharing public resources with external systems. Note, that if objects are shared externally, then they are visible to anyone who has access to the URL which provides the resource without any login credentials. </p>
    <p>Next to "Public
      access" you can choose your public access option: "None", "Can view" or "Can edit and view".
 Public access refers to users which are logged into the system.       Edit also implies deleting the report. </p>
    <p>To share with a group, simply start typing the name of
      the group and the "Search for user groups" input field and select your desired group. Click on
      the "+" icon next to the input field to share with that group. For each group you can set an
      access option, similar to public access.</p>
    <p>Sharing with a user group implies that all users in that group will get access to the
      shared object. To create a user group you can go to the dashboard module and click on "Groups". This will lead you to the list of groups where you can click "Add new" in
      the top right corner. Creating user groups is open for everyone from the dashboard
      module.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1595"></a>8.2.&nbsp;Sharing and access control</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The objects which support sharing are indicator, indicator group, indicator group set,
      data dictionary, data set, program, standard report, resource, report table, chart, map and
      user group. Out of those objects, report table, chart, map and user group are open for
      everyone to create privately. Private means that the objects are available only to yourself or
      potentially to a number of user groups if you choose to share the object. These objects are
      referred to as "open" objects and can be created by all users. The remaining objects require
      that your user account has the authority to create them. These objects are referred to as
      "non-open" objects.</p>
    <p>A user can be granted the authority to create publicly accessible objects or privately
      accessible objects. In order to create a publicly accessible object (available for viewing or
      editing by anyone) your user account must have the authority to do so. As an example, to
      create a publicly accessible chart, your user must have the "Create public chart" authority
      granted. The authority to create private objects applies only to non-open objects. For
      example, to allow a user to create indicators which will only be accessible to that user and
      not to everyone, the user can be issued with the "Create private indicator" authority.</p>
    <p>Sharing a non-open object with another person and let her edit the object requires that
      the person's user account has the authority for updating that type of objects granted. For
      instance, if you want to let another person edit your indicator, that person's user account
      must have the "Update indicator" authority granted. This does not apply for open
      objects.</p>
    <p>When you create a new object it will automatically become viewable for everyone if your
      user account has the authority to create public objects. As an example, if you create a
      standard report and you have the "Create public standard report" authority granted, the report
      will become viewable for everyone. If you do not have that authority granted the report will
      be viewable only to yourself. After you have created an object, you may navigate to the
      "Sharing settings" dialog and set your desired access control level.</p>
    <p>If you need a user account which is able to view absolutely all objects you can create a
      user role with the "ALL" authority and assign a user to that role. If you need to switch
      between a "complete" view of objects and a "personal" view of objects it is recommended to
      create two user accounts, one assigned with the "ALL" authority and one without.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1602"></a>8.3.&nbsp;Sharing applied</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a
      DHIS instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the
      organisation has a set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all
      countries, while all countries will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators
      and reports. In this scenario the following approach could work: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up one user group for global personnel.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up a user group for personnel in each country.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for
          the global user group only.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the
          country user group and the global user group only.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but
      maintained by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and
      reports could be viewed and maintained by the country and global personnel, without being
      visible or impacting the system for other countries in the organisation.</p>
    <p>A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and
      implementing partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those
      entities. That way each implementing partner could create and share their reports within their
      organisation without affecting or allowing access to others. Reports could also be shared with
      supervisors and funding agencies at the end of reporting periods.</p>
    <p>Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs.
      Typically there is a need for having general reports and charts for the department while
      allowing the health programs to develop specific reports and charts for internal use. This can
      be achieved by creating user groups for each health program. Later, when developing reports
      and charts, these can be made viewable and editable to the program user group only. This way
      the reports will not be visible to other programs and users. This is beneficial because the
      reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible list of reports of other
      users are kept shorter and more relevant.</p>

  <p>Dashboards are intended to provide quick access to different analytical objects (maps, charts, reports, tables, etc) to an individual user. Dashboards can also be shared with user groups. For instance, a user or administrator could create a dashboard called "Malaria" which might contain all relevant information on malaria. This dashboard could then be shared with the user group called "Malaria control", which might consist of all users of the malaria control programme. All users within this group would then be able to view the same dashboard.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dashboards_setup"></a>9.1.&nbsp;Setting up the dashboard</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The dashboard can contain any number of objects (charts, maps, reports, tables, resources, etc). These can be freely arranged on the dashboard as you wish.  Dashboard items can be located and added by searching for favourites, resources, users or messages in the available search box and clicking on the "Add" button. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dashboard/dashboard_overview.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>In this screen shot, the dashboard has already been populated with a number of objects, such as charts, map views, tables and messages. There are several hyperlink options available on each item: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Remove</p>
        <p>Allows you to remove the item from the dashboard when you have the appropriate user rights.</p>

        <p>Share interpretation</p>
        <p>Allows you to share an interpretation of the dashboard item. Your interpretation will be shared publicly with other users of the DHIS2 system, in the "Interpretation" section of the dashboard. </p>

        <p>Resizes the dashboard item. There are 3 sizes in which to choose from. </p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Maps, charts and tables can be viewed as full size as images (in the case of charts and map views) or as HTML resources (in the case of reports, tables and messages). </p>
    <p>To reorder how the dashboard appears, simply drag-and-drop any of the objects to a new position. In order to change between the various dashboards which are available, simply select the listed items that are available to review. The list can be scrolled though by using the &lt;, &gt; symbols to the left of the dashboard names.  </p>

    <p>In addition to adding items or modifying the layout of a dashboard, further options allow you to add additional dashboards, modify their names, delete an entire dashboard an share the dashboard with other users. These additional items can be managed using the "Add," "Manage," and "Share" links on the top left of the dashboard next to the dashboard names. </p>

    <p>DHIS2 has certain functions to facilitate communication between different users and user groups. This type of communication is important to facilitate feedback regarding data quality,  timeliness of submissions, or to simply answer a question which a particular user may have. </p>
    <p>Feedback messages are sent to a particular group of users and can be sent by all users who
      have access to the dashboard module. In order to enable the receipt of feedback messages sent
      from the dashboard, you must set the system setting "Feedback recipients" which is
      available from the Maintenance-&gt;System settings dialog. Be sure to define a user group
      (e.g. "Feedback recipients") with all of the users who should receive feedback
      messages. Refer to the section in this manual on "User groups" for more information
      of how to do this. Once the "Feedback recipients" user group has been defined, each
      time a feedback message is sent, it will appear as a message in each of the "Feedback
      recipients" message queue within DHIS2. Note that messages will not be sent to users
      email addresses, but will only appear within the DHIS2 application. </p>
    <p>To send a new feedback message, simply select "Write feedback" from the dashboard. Provide a subject and text in the respective text boxes. The message will appear in all of the specified users message queue. </p>
    <p>Messages can be sent to either a specific user, user  group or groups of users who have been assigned to particular organisation units. To write a new message, simply click "Messages" from the dashboard screen and then press the "Write message" button.. Select an organisation unit (or group of organisation units) from the "Recipients" organisational unit tree. In the "To user" box you can select specific users or user groups. Provide a Subject and Text. To send the message, press the "Send" button. You can discard the message by pressing the "Discard" button as seen in the screenshot below.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataEntry"></a>10.1.&nbsp;Data entry with DHIS 2</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To open the data entry window hover over the Apps button. A
    drop down menu will appear listing the apps provided by DHIS 2. Click
    on the <span class="guibutton">Data Entry</span> option.</p>
    <p>The data entry module is where aggregated data is manually registered in the DHIS 2 database. Data is registered for an organisation unit, a period, and a set of data elements (data set) at a time. A data set often corresponds to a paper-based data collection tool. </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1707"></a>10.1.1.&nbsp;Selecting the data entry form</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>To start entering data the first step is to open the correct form by following these
        steps:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Locate the orgunit you want to register data for in the tree menu to the left.
            Expand and close branches by clicking on the +/- symbols. A quick way to find an orgunit
            is to use the search box just above the tree (the green symbol), but you need to write
            in the full name to get a match.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select a data set from the dropdown list of data sets available to your selected orgunit.  </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select a period to register data for. The available periods are controlled by the
            period type of the data set (reporting frequency). You can jump a year back or forward
            by using the arrows above the period.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>By now you should see the data entry form. From a form design perspective, there are
        three types for forms: default forms, section forms and custom forms. If a custom form
        exists, it will be displayed, followed in order of precedence by a section form, and finally
        a default form.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_overview.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1723"></a>10.1.2.&nbsp;Entering data</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Start entering data by clicking inside the first field and type in the value. Move to
        the next field using the Tab button. Shift+Tab will take you back one step. You can also use
        the "up" and "down" arrow keys, as well as the Enter key, to navigate between the form cells. The values are saved
        immediately and do not require to be saved at a later stage. A green field indicates that
        the value has been saved in the system (on the server).</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Input validation:</strong></span> If you type in an invalid value, e.g.
        a character in a field that only accepts numeric values you will get a pop-up that explains
        the problem and the field will be coloured yellow (not saved) until you have corrected the
        value. If you have defined a min/max range for the field (data element+organisation unit
        combination) a pop-up message will notify you when the value is out of range, and the value
        will remain unsaved until you have changed the value (or updated the range and then
        re-entered the value). </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Disabled fields:</strong></span> If a field is disabled (grey) it means
        that the field can and should not be filled. The cursor will automatically jump to the next
        open field. </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data history:</strong></span> By double-clicking on any input field in the form a data history window opens showing the last 12 values registered for the current field (organisation unit+data element+categoryoptioncombo) in a bar chart. This window also shows the min and max range and allows for adjusting the range for the specific organisation unit and data element combination. </p>

      </div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Follow Up:</strong></span>  In the data history window there is also a feature to tag or star a value. E.g. a suspicious value that needs further investigation can be kept in the system, but marked for Follow-Up. In the Data Quality module you can run a Follow-Up analysis and view all values marked for Follow-Up, and then later edit the values if proved incorrect.  </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Audit trail: </strong></span>The audit trail allows you to view other data values which have been entered prior to the current value. As an example, the following data element was changed from its original value  to 120. The audit trail shows when the data value was altered along with which user made the changes.</p>

      <p>If you wish to enter data which has already been entered, simply replace the data entry value with the update values. </p>
      <p>If you want to delete a data value completely, you should select the value of interest, and press "Delete" on your keyboard. If you enter a zero and the data element has been configured to not store zeros, the previous data value (i.e. the one you wish to modify) will not be overwritten with the new value. Therefore, it is better practice to delete the data value completely (waiting for the cell to turn green) and then to enter the new value. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataEntry_1"></a>10.1.4.&nbsp;Validating data in the form</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>When all the available values for the form has been filled in you can run a validation check on the data in the form. Click on the "Run Validation" button in the top right (at the beginning of the data entry page) or lower left (at the end of your data entry page) corner. All validation rules which involves data elements in the current form (dataset) will be run against the new data. Upon completion you will be presented with a list of violations or a simply a message that says "The data entry screen successfully passed validation".  See the Data Quality chapter for information on how to define such validation rules.</p>
      <p>When you have corrected any erroneous values and are done with the form the recommended practice is to click on the Complete button below the form to register the form as complete. This information is used when generating completeness reports for district, county, province or the national level.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">

      <p>The data entry module will function even if during data entry the Internet connectivity
        is not stable. In order to utilize this functionality, you must login to the server while
        Internet connectivity is present, but if during data entry, the Internet link between your
        computer and the server becomes unstable, data can still be entered into the data entry
        form, saved to your local computer, and then pushed to the server once the Internet
        connectivity has been restored. Data can be entered and stored locally while being offline
        and uploaded to the central server when on-line. This means that the on-line deployment
        strategy will be more viable in areas with unstable Internet connectivity. The total
        bandwidth usage is greatly reduced since forms no longer are retrieved from the server for
        each rendering.</p>
      <p>When the server is able to be reached through the Internet connection, a message is displayed  at the top of the data entry screen  below. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_online1.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>If the Internet connection should disconnect for some reason during the data entry process, this will be detected by the application, and you will be informed that your data will be stored locally. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_offline1.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Data entry can proceed as normal. Once you have entered all of the necessary data, and the application detects that the server is back on-line, you will be informed that you have data which needs to be synchronized with the server. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">

      </div>
      <p>Once the data has successfully synchronized with the server, you will receive a confirmation message that the data has been successfully uploaded to the server. </p>

      <p>In some scenarios it is beneficial to enter data for multiple organisation units in the
        same data entry form, for instance if there are few data elements in the form and a huge
        number of organisation units in the hierarchy. In that case you can enable
        multi-organisation unit data entry by going to "System settings" and tick the "Enable multi
        organisation unit forms" setting. Then, in data entry, select the organisation unit
        immediately above the organisation unit you want to enter for in the hierarchy. Note that
        this only work for the "section" based forms. You should now see the data elements appearing
        as columns and the organisation units appearing as rows in the form. Note that the data
        entry forms should still be assigned to the facilities that you actually enter data for,
        i.e. the organisation units now appearing in the form.</p>

  <p>The data quality module provides means to improve the accuracy and reliability of the data in the system. This can be done through validation rules and various statistical checks. All the functionality described below can be accessed from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Data Quality module.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1787"></a>11.1.&nbsp;Overview of data quality checks</h2></div></div></div>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Correctness:</em></span> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</p>

    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element (based on all previous data registered).</p>

    <p>You can access Validation Rule Analysis from the Apps-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</p>
    <p>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data
      registered in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition
      defined through the validation rule expression is not met, i.e. the condition is false.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Selecting what data to validate:</strong></span> </p>
    <p>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. </p>
    <p>Second, choose between including all validation rules or all validation rules from a single group. </p>
    <p>Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click <span class="italic">validate</span>.</p>

    </div>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Validation results:</strong></span></p>
    <p>The analysis process will run for a while depending on the amount of data that is being analysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <span class="italic">validation passed successfully</span> is displayed. </p>
    <p>If validation violations were found, they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. </p>
    <p>The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to fix incorrect data.</p>
    <p>The validation violations can be exported to a PDF document by clicking on the Download as PDF button, and to a Microsoft Excel workbook by clicking on the Download as Excel button.</p>

    <p>You can access Outlier analysis from the Apps-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values
      that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance, but they
      often indicate a measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution (leading to very high
      numbers). In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be
      cautious in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is
      based on the standard normal distribution.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Select what data to analyse:</strong></span></p>
    <p>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. </p>
    <p>Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. </p>
    <p>Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. </p>
    <p>Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. </p>
    <p>Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard
      deviations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an
      outlier.</p>

    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Analysis result:</strong></span></p>
    <p>The potential outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, and maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</p>

    <p>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the  pre-defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined by the system in the data administration module. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</p>

    <p>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Correctness:</em></span> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</p>

    <p>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1908"></a>12.3.1.&nbsp;Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the values. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the &#8216;comment&#8217; box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the &#8216;default data entry form&#8217; option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1911"></a>12.3.2.&nbsp;Generated min-max values </h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>It is possible to generate the min-max value, element-wise, using the DHIS2. In such case you merely need to click on the &#8216;Generate min-max&#8217; button near the upper right corner. In case of default data entry screen the min and max values, when generated, will appear on the left and right side of the data entry box. In case you deselect the default data entry form the generated values will appear on the top right end of the screen.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="validationRule"></a>12.4.&nbsp;Validation Rule</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</p>
    <p>To add a validation rule, just follow these steps:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click on the <span class="italic">Add new</span> button</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide a descriptive <span class="italic">Name</span> for the validation rule. The name must be unique among the validation rules.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide a <span class="italic">Description</span> for the validation rule.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Importance</span> you wish to assign to the validation rule: <span class="italic">high</span>, <span class="italic">medium</span> or <span class="italic">low</span>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Rule type</span>. For validating correct data, choose <span class="italic">Validation</span>. For monitoring  data according to a rule, choose <span class="italic">Surveillance</span> and follow the extra instructions below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Period type</span> for the data being validated.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select an <span class="italic">Operator</span>. The operator options are <span class="italic">equal</span> (==), <span class="italic">not equal</span> (!=), <span class="italic">greater than</span> (&gt;), <span class="italic">greater than or equal</span> (&gt;=), <span class="italic">less than</span> (&lt;), <span class="italic">less than or equal to</span> (&gt;=) and <span class="italic">compulsory pair</span>.</p>
        <p>The compulsory pair operator allows you to require that data values must be entered for a form for both left and right sides of the expression, or for neither side. In other words, you can require that if one field in a form is filled, then one or more other fields must also be filled.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Define the <span class="italic">left side</span> and <span class="italic">right side</span> of the validation rule expression. First, provide a description for the expression. Second, build the expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by double-clicking one in the available data elements list to the right. Alternatively one can select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area.</p>
        <p>There are three states which can be set to alter how the validation rule will be evaluated if there is any missing data. </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Skip if any value is missing: The rule will be skipped if any of the values which compose the expression are missing. This is the default option. </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Skip if all values are missing: The rule will be skipped only if all of the operands which compose it are missing. </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Never skip: The rule will never be skipped in case of missing data, and all missing operands will be treated effectively as a zero.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Save each expression by clicking <span class="italic">Save</span>, then save the validation rule by clicking <span class="italic">Save</span>.</p>
    <p>To edit a validation rule, click the name the relevant validation rule in the list  and select "Edit" from the context menu. Then follow the same procedures as above when creating a new rule.</p>
    <p>To delete a validation rule, click the name of the validation rule to be deleted, and select "Remove" from the context menu.</p>
    <p>Validation rule names can be translated to other languages by selecting the name of the validation rule and selecting "Translate" from the context menu. </p>
    <p>To view validation rule details, click the name of the validation rule, and then select "Show details" from the context menu. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1972"></a>12.5.&nbsp;Surveillance Rule</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>As well as checking for correct data, you can use a validation rules  to find unexpected data  values when compared with data from previous time periods. These kinds of validation rules are called <span class="italic">surveillance</span> rules.  In surveillance rules, the right and left side expressions can include statistical functions (such as AVG or STDDEV) of samples derived from data elements in past periods for a particular organization level.</p>
    <p>Statistical functions in surveillance rules operate over samples generated by evaluating expressions in past periods.  The particular periods are based on an <span class="emphasis"><em>annual sample count</em></span> (how many past years to include in the sample) and a <span class="emphasis"><em>sequential sample count</em></span> (how many periods, before and after each annual sample point, to include in the samples).  For example, suppose a monthly surveillance rule had an annual sample count of 3 (years) and a sequential sample count of 2 (months).  There would be up to 17 samples based on a window of 5 monthly samples (around the current month) in each of 3 preceding years, together with the two periods preceding the current month in the current year.  Note that if surveillance rules operate over a large number of samples, their execution may take substantial time and system resources.</p>
    <p>To add a surveillance rule, follow the steps above for validation rules, choosing a <span class="italic">
        <span class="italic">rule type</span>
      </span> of <span class="italic">Surveillance</span>. This adds the following validation rule options:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Choose an <span class="italic">Organisation unit level</span> for this surveillance rule. If the data you wish to monitor is not entered at this level, it will be aggregated from lower level organisation units  in the organisation unit hierarchy.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter the <span class="italic">Sequential sample count</span>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter the <span class="italic">Annual sample count</span>.</p>
        <p>The sequential sample count <span class="italic">or</span> annual sample count must be at least 1.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>A surveillance rule may contain data elements for periods that are longer than the period given for the rule. This is useful, for example, if you want to divide a data element value by the population count, and the population count is entered annually. The data for the longer period type (e.g. population count) must be entered for a period that overlaps with the start of the period being evaluated. For example, if the period being evaluated is the week starting January 6, 2014, the yearly population count must be entered for the year containing January 6 2014. If the data element is from a longer period type than the rule period type, it must have an aggregation operator of average, not sum. In other words, only data elements that don't sum through time (like population count) can be used from longer periods than the rule period.</p>
    <p>The statistical functions available to surveillance rules are:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>AVG</em></span> returns the arithmetic mean (average) of the sample values.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>COUNT</em></span> returns the number of sample values.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>STDDEV</em></span> returns the standard deviation of the sample values against the average.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>MEDIAN</em></span> returns the median of the samples</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>MAX</em></span> returns the maximum value among the samples</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>MIN</em></span> returns the minimum value among the samples</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
	<p><span class="emphasis"><em>VSUM</em></span> returns the sum of all the sample values</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>For surveillance rules, the <span class="italic">skip for missing</span> option has additional meaning.   For past periods, absent data values for a period will lead to a missing sample point, rather than skipping the entire rule.  The statistical functions will then operate over the available samples.  Also, when values are being aggregated from lower levels of the organisation unit hierarchy, <span class="italic">skip for missing</span> skips the rule (or the sample point) when values are unavailable <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> any of the organisational subunits.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="validationRuleGroup"></a>12.6.&nbsp;Validation Rule Group</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related validation rules. Another advantage of using validation rule groups is that it can later be run separately, instead of running all validation rules.</p>
    <p>You can also use a validation rule group to configure how users are notified of alerts from scheduled validation runs. To do this, you should identify a set of validation rules you want to evaluate regularly, and a group of users who should be notified of any exceptions to these rules. Then:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Be sure that one or more user groups are defined containing all the users you wish to notify.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Define a validation rule group for a set of validation rules. In the section User groups to alert, select one or more user groups to be notified.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>By repeating these two steps, you can build any set of relations between validation rules and users to fit your needs.</p>
    <p>When you create or edit a validation rule group, there is an option called <span class="italic">Only organisation unit related users are alerted</span>. If this is set to <span class="italic">Yes</span>, then each user in the group(s) will be alerted only for validation exceptions for an organisation unit to which the user has been assigned through user management -- or for any lower-level organisation unit under that organisation unit. If this is set to <span class="italic">No</span>, then each user in the assigned user group(s) will be alerted for all validation exceptions in the group, regardless of organisation unit.</p>
    <p>To enable routine scheduling of data validation runs, choose Data Administration from the Maintenance menu. Then click on Scheduling. If scheduling is active, click on the Stop button, then select the Data monitoring strategy of All daily. Finally enable scheduling by clicking on the Start button.</p>

    <p>Indicators are composed of multiple data elements, and typically consist of a numerator
        and denominator. Calculated totals do not have a denominator. Indicators are never entered directly in DHIS2 through data entry, but are derived from combinations of
        data elements and factors. Indicators are used to calculate coverage rates, incidence and
        other values are a result of data element values that have been entered into the system. </p>
    <p>To access the Indicator maintains page, press Maintenance -&gt; Data Element and Indicators  and then pressing "Indicator" from the left pane or the main dialog.  Similar to data elements, you can add, delete, modify and view extra information about the indicators in the system. </p>

        <p>Days: A special operator "D" is available in formulas. This operator will
            always provide the number of days for a given indicator calculation. As an example, if
            you wish to calculate the "Percentage of time vaccine refrigerator was
            non-functional", you could define the numerator as ("D-"Number of days
            vaccine refrigerator was available"")/"D". For example, if the
            fridge was available 25 days in June, the indicator would be calculated as
            (30-25/25)*100=17%. If you were however to calculate the total for Quarter 1, the number
            of days ("D") would be equal to 31+28+31=90. Thus, the "D" parameter
            will always be the number of days in the period of interest.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Org unit group counts: Org unit groups can be utilized in formulas and will be
            substituted by the number of organisation units in the group. During aggregation, the org
            units in the group will be intersected with the part of the org unit hierarchy being
            requested. As an example, this lets you use the number of public facilities in a
            specific district in indicators. This is useful e.g. when creating facility
            infrastructure surveys and reports.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Constants:  Indicators may make use of constants. Constants are static values which will be applied uniformly to the indicator formula. Constants are applied AFTER data element values have been aggregated.</p>

    <p>Indicator types simply define a factor that will be applied during aggregation. Indicator values that are calculate during a data mart export or report table generation process will appear properly formatted, and will therefore not require an additional multiplier (e.g. 100 in the case of percents) for the values to appear correctly formatted. </p>
    <p>The indicator type maintenance panel has all of the same functions (Add new, Edit, Translate, Delete, and Information) as the Indicator maintenance section. </p>
    <p>There are only two fields that need to be filled-in to create an indicator type, Name and Factor, as seen below. Name refers to the Indicator type (e.g. Per cent, Per thousand, Per ten thousand, etc). The factor is the numeric factor that will be multiplied to the indicator formula during the calculation of the indicator. </p>

      <p>As of version 2.4 of DHIS2, the "Calculated data element" object has been deprecated. Instead, a calculated data element can be created by creating an indicator type with a factor of "1" and by setting the "Number" option to "Yes". The effect of setting the "Number" option to "Yes" will be that the indicator will effectively not have a denominator. You will therefore only be able to define a numerator, which will serve as the formula of the calculated data element.</p>

    <p>The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Standard reports:</strong></span> Standard reports are built on pivot tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF  files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataset reports:</strong></span> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dashboard:</strong></span> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display  up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data Visualizer:</strong></span> Do flexible visualizations of your data
      as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several
      chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The
      charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal
      dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Orgunit distribution reports:</strong></span> These reports are generated
      off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of
      health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports
      are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and
      downloads in PDF, excel, and CSV are available.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting rate summary:</strong></span> These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages  showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Web-based pivot tables:</strong></span> The built in pivot table tool is a  web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for pivoting manipulations of the tables. It allows for large amounts of data to be downloaded offline for analysis as well.  </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>GIS:</strong></span> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points.  See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into DHIS 2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="standard_reports"></a>14.2.&nbsp;Using standard reports</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You access the available reports by navigating to Apps-&gt;Reports. In the report menu in the left bar, click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/standard_reports_ke.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>You run/view a report by clicking on the name of the report and then selecting "Create" from the contextual menu. If there are any pre-defined paramaters, you will see a report parameter window where you must fill in the values needed for
      orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on what has been defined in the underlying report
      table(s). Click on "Get Report" when you are ready. The report will either appear
      directly in your browser or be available as a PDF file for download, depending on your
      browser settings for handling PDF files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your
      computer for later use. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataset_reports"></a>14.3.&nbsp;Using dataset reports</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either raw or aggregated data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and not for default or section forms.</p>
    <p>You can access data set reports from Apps-&gt;Reports.</p>
    <p>A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataset:</strong></span> The data set you want to display.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting period: </strong></span>The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods. This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected monthly. A data set's period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select the period type (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use data for selected unit only:</strong></span> Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children, but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children. If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting Organisation unit:</strong></span> Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any level in the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the option above).</p>
    <p>When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on "Generate". The report will appear as HTML in a printer-friendly format. Use  the print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as HTML) the report.You can also export the data set report in Excel and PDF formats.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="resource"></a>14.4.&nbsp;Using resources</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The resource tool allows you to upload both files from your local computer to the DHIS
      server and to add links to other resources on the Internet through URLs. If you want to share
      a direct link to the DHIS2 resources you can right click on the "view resource" button and
      copy the link address.</p>
    <p>To create a resource click on the "Add new" button. Enter a name for the resource, then choose between uploading a file or external URL. If you chose file upload click "Choose file" and select your file your local computer. If you chose URL enter the link to the resource on the Internet. Then click "Save".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="reporting_reporting_rate_summary"></a>14.5.&nbsp;Using reporting rate summary</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Access the reporting rate summary from the Apps-&gt;Reports menu. Reporting rate
      summaries will show how many datasets (forms) that have been submitted by organisation unit
      and period. There are two methods available to calculate reporting rates
      (completeness):</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Based on complete data set registrations. A complete data set registration refers to a
          user marking a data entry form as complete, typically by clicking the complete button in
          the data entry screen, hereby indicating to the system that she considers the form to be
          complete. This is i.e. a subjective approach to calculating completeness.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Based on compulsory data element: You can define any number of data elements in a data
          set to be compulsory. This implies that data values must be captured for all data elements
          which have been marked as compulsory in order for the data set to be considered complete.
          This is i.e. an objective approach to calculating completeness.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>The reporting rate summary will for each row show a range of measures:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Expected reports: Indicates how many data entry complete registrations are expected.
          This number is based on the number of organisation units the relevant data set has been
          assigned to (enabled for data entry).</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Percent: The percentage of reports registered as complete based on the number
          expected.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Reports on time: Same as actual reports, only reports registered as complete within
          the maximum number of days after the end of the reporting period. This number of days

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Percent on time: Same as percentage, only reports registered as complete on time used
          as numerator.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2245"></a>15.1.&nbsp;Pivot Table overview</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The pivot table app enables users to create pivot tables, using all available data
        dimensions in DHIS 2. A pivot table is a dynamic tool for
      data analysis which lets you quickly summarize and arrange data according to its dimensions.
      Examples of data dimensions in DHIS 2 are data dimension itself (e.g data elements, indicators and events ),
      periods (representing the time period for which the data represents) and the organisational hierarchy (representing the
      geographical location of the data). From these dimensions you can freely select dimension
        <span class="italic">items</span> to include in the pivot table. Additional dimensions can be created in DHIS2, using the group set functionality, to allow for different aggregation pathways, such as aggregation by "Partner" or facility type. </p>
    <p>A pivot table can arrange data dimensions on <span class="italic">columns</span>,
        <span class="italic">rows</span>, and as <span class="italic">filters</span>.
      When you place a data dimension on columns, the pivot table will display one column per
      dimension item. If you place multiple data dimensions on columns, the pivot table will display
      one column for all combinations of the items in the selected dimensions. When you place a data
      dimension on rows, the pivot table will display one row per dimension item in a similar
      fashion. The dimensions you select as filters will not be included in the pivot table, but
      will aggregate and filter the table data based on the selected filter items.</p>
    <p>The work-flow for creating a simple pivot table is:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select dimension items in the left menu, for instance a few data elements or indicators.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Layout" on the top menu and arrange the data dimensions as columns, rows, and
          filters. You can leave the selection as it is if desired.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Update".</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <p>Based on the demo database, a pivot table approximately as below will be displayed. Notice
      how indicators are listed on columns and periods as rows.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/pivot_table/basic_pivot.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2267"></a>15.2.&nbsp;Selecting dimension items</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The left menu will list sections for all available data dimensions. From each section you
      can select any number of dimension items. As an example, you can open the section for data
      elements and select any number of data elements from the available list. You can select an
      item by marking it and clicking on the arrow in the section header or simply double-clicking
      on the item. Before you can use a data dimension in your pivot table you must at least select
      one dimension item. If you arrange a dimension as columns or rows but do not select any
      dimension items, the dimension will be ignored.</p>
    <p>At least one member of the data dimension is required for all pivot tables. Available types include the following:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Indicators</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Data elements</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Reporting rates</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Event data items</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Program indicators</p>
        </li></ul></div>
    <p>These dimensions can be combined together, so that you can display for instance aggregate data with reporting rates, or event data items together with program indicators, all in the same pivot tables. For the "data element" data dimension, you are also able to select "Totals" and "Details", which will allow you to view different category combination options together on the same pivot table. </p>
    <p>For the period dimension you can choose between using fixed periods or relative periods.
      An example of a fixed period is "January 2012". To select fixed periods start by selecting a
      period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from the list of available
      periods. </p>
    <p>Relative periods are periods relative to the current date. Examples of relative
      periods are "Last month", "Last 12 months", "Last 5 years". Relative periods can be selected
      by ticking the check-boxes next to each period. The main advantage of using relative periods is
      that when you save a pivot table favorite, it will stay updated with the latest data as time
      goes by without the need for constantly updating it.</p>
    <p>For the organisation unit dimension you can select any number of organisation units from
      the hierarchy. To select all organisation units below a specific parent organisation unit,
      right click and click "Select all children". To manually select multiple organisation units,
      click and hold the Ctrl button while clicking on organisation units. You can tick "User
      org unit", "User sub-units" or "User sub-x2-units"
      in order to dynamically insert the organisation unit or units associated with your user account.
      This is useful when you save a pivot table favorite and want to share it with other users, as the
      organisation units linked with the other user's account will be used when viewing the favorite.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Dynamic dimensions can consist of organisation unit group sets, data element group sets, or category option group sets which have been configured with the type of of "Disaggregation". Once the group sets have been configured, they will be come available in the pivot tables, and can be used as additional analysis dimensions, for instance to analyze aggregate data by Type of organisational unit or Implementing partner. Dynamic dimensions work the same as fixed dimensions. </p>
    <div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="resources/images/admon/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
      <p>Some dynamic dimensions may contain many members. This can cause issues with certain browsers due to the length of the URL when many dimension members are selected. A special "All" checkbox is available for dynamic dimensions, which allows you to include all available dimensions implicitly in your pivot table, without specifying each and every dimension member.</p>

    <p>After selecting data dimensions it is time to arrange your pivot table. Click "Layout" in
      the top menu to open the layout screen. In this screen you can position your data dimensions
      as table columns, rows or filters by clicking and dragging the dimensions from the dimensions
      list to the respective column, row and filter lists. You can set any number of dimensions in
      any of the lists. For instance, you can click on "Organisation units" and drag it to the row
      list in order to position the organisation unit dimension as table rows.  Note that
      indicators, data elements and data set reporting rates are part of the common "Data" dimension
      and will be displayed together in the pivot table. For instance, after selecting indicators
      and data elements in the left menu, you can drag "Organisation Unit" from the available dimensions list to
      the row dimension list in order to arrange them as rows in the pivot table.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">

    </div>
    <p>After you have set up your pivot table you can click "Update" to render your pivot table,
      or click "Hide" to hide the layout screen without any changes taking effect. Since we in our
      example have selected both the period and organisation unit dimension as rows, the pivot table
      will generate all combinations of the items in these dimensions and produce a table like
      this:</p>

    <p>The analysis apps in DHIS 2 are completely integrated, so you can easily switch
   between pivot table, chart and map visualization of your data. When you have made a pivot table
   you can click e.g. "Chart" in the top right corner and then select "Open this table as chart".</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="25%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/pivot_table/pivot_integration.png" align="middle"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>If you just want to visualize a small part of your pivot table as a chart, you can click directly on a
    value in the table instead. A menu will appear. If you mouse hover the "Open selection as chart" option you can see
    that some of the dimension headers in the table are highlighted, indicating what data will be visualized as a chart.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2397"></a>15.7.&nbsp;Downloading data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You can download the data in the current pivot table by clicking on "Download" in the top
      menu. The data can be downloaded in various formats including Microsoft Excel, CSV, HTML.  The data table will have one
      column per dimension and contain names of the dimension items. You can easily create a pivot
      table in Microsoft Excel from the downloaded Excel file by clicking on "pivot table" in the
      top panel, then clicking on "create pivot table", then marking the data range in the
      spreadsheet before clicking "OK".u can </p>
    <p>Data can also be downloaded in JSON, XML, Excel, and CSV as plain data formats with different identification schemes (ID, Code, and Name).   The data document will use identifiers of the
      dimension items and will be opened in a new browser window in order to reveal the URL of the
      request to the Web API in the address bar. This will be useful for developers of apps and 
      other client modules based on the DHIS 2 Web API or for those who require a plan data source, for instance for import into statistical packages.</p>
    <p>For advanced users, two additional options are available under "Advanced". JXRML will produce a template of a Jasper Report which can be further customized based on your exact needs and used as the basis for a standard report in DHIS2. The "Raw data SQL" will provide the actual SQL statement used to generate the pivot table. This could then be used as a data source in a Jasper report, or as the basis for an SQL view. </p>
    <p>Lastly, the pivot table app allows you to download data in CSV format directly without first rendering the data in the Web Browser. This will help overcome any constraint in the system settings  that has been set in regards to the maximum number of analytic records. This allows for much larger batches of data to be downloaded and used for later offline analysis. This can be done by clicking on the arrow beside the update button.</p>

    <p>When selecting and arranging dimensions there are a few constraints that apply. All of
      these constraints are validated and the pivot table module will provide feedback if any
      constraint is violated.</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

        <p>A table cannot contain more than the maximum number of analytics records which have been specified through the system settings. The maximum number of records could also be constrained by the maximum RAM which is available to your browser.

      </li></ul></div>

      <p>Pivot tables in DHIS2 are limited to a system set paramater, which controls the number of data values which can be returned. The reason for this is two fold. First, it would be easy to overwhelm the server with a very complicated request for a large pivot table. Second, the amount of data which is able to be rendered in a browser is fairly limited. If you are having problems with very large or complex tables, consider to try and reduce the number of items. It is usually more useful to have smaller, concise tables which are easier to understand and which address a particular analysis. </p>

    <p>The data visualizer module enables users to easily create dynamic data analysis and visualizations through charts and data tables.  You can freely select content (like indicators, periods and organisation units) for your analysis. This module can be accessed by selecting Data Visualizer from the app menu. The image below shows the viewport of the module. For a quick start:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p> Look under the "Data" heading and select an indicator group from the list of groups. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Look under "Available indicators" and select a few indicators from the list by double-clicking on them.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Update" in the top bar and see the chart unfold.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <p>The data visualizer is designed firstly to be easy-to-use - you can simply select the indicators, data elements, periods and organisation units you want to include and click "Update" to get your visualization. Secondly it is designed  to be fast and work well over poor Internet connections - charts are generated in the web browser and very little data is transferred over the Internet.</p>

      </li></ol></div>
    <p>The visualization module lets you use these dimensions completely flexible in terms of appearing as series, categories and filter. Understanding these concepts is most easily done by looking at the screenshot from the opening page below: </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/visualizer/series_category_filter.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>More formally this can be described as following:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (e.g. periods or data
          elements) which you want to visualize in order to emphasize trends or relations in its
          data.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Categories: A category is a set of elements (e.g. indicators or organisation units)
          for which you want to compare its data.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Filter: Since most charts are two-dimensional, a filter must be used on the third dimension  in order to use only a single element for the chart to become meaningful.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2491"></a>16.4.&nbsp;Selecting indicators and data elements</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The visualizer module can display any number of indicators and data elements in a chart and data table. Both indicators and data elements can be selected and appear together in the same chart, with their order of appearance the same as the order in which they are selected. You can select indicators by choosing Indicators from the "Data" header  and selecting an indicator group from the list of groups below it. This will make the indicators in the selected group appear in the list under "Available indicators" to the left. From that list you can double click on any indicator in order to select it, this will move it to the list under "Selected indicators". Alternatively you can mark one or more indicators and click the single-arrow button. To select all indicators you simply click on the double-arrow button. To deselect indicators you can do correspondingly in the "Selected indicators" list.</p>
    <p>To select data elements choose Data Elements from the "Data" header. The same principle for selecting and deselecting indicators applies for data elements.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2495"></a>16.5.&nbsp;Selecting reporting rates</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The visualizer can display reporting rates in a chart, by itself or together with indicators and data elements. Reporting rates can be selected by choosing Reporting Rates from the "Data" header. Reporting rates are defined by data sets. It can be selected by double-clicking in the list of available data sets to the left.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2498"></a>16.6.&nbsp;Selecting fixed and relative periods</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Click on the "Periods" header. For fixed periods, select a period type from the combo box. You can select any number of fixed periods from any period type. Below the fixed period you will find the relative period checkboxes and you may select as many as you like. The names should be fairly self-descriptive and they are relative to the current date, meaning that if the current month is March and you select "Last month", the month of February will be included in the chart. You are also free to combine fixed periods and relative periods in the same chart. Overlapping periods will be filtered so that they only appear once.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2501"></a>16.7.&nbsp;Selecting organisation units</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You can select which organisation units to include in the chart by clicking the
      "Organisation units" header. This section features three ways of selecting organisation units, which can be selected by clicking on the gear icon directly below the organisation units header. The default mode is called "Organisation units" and lets you select the organisation units you want to appear in the chart from the tree. This mode also features three checkboxes. Checking "User org unit" will disable the organisation unit tree and give you the organisation unit that is related to the current/logged in user instead. This is also useful for administrators as they can create a meaningful "system" favorite with this option checked and all users will find their respective organisation unit when they open it. The the same concept goes for "User sub-units" and "User sub-x2-units". The second mode is called "Select levels". Here you can select all organisation units at one or more levels. However, at the same time you also have the option to select parent organisation units in the tree, which makes it easy to select e.g. all facilities inside one or more districts. The same thing goes for the third mode called "Select groups". Here you can select all organisation units inside one or more groups and parent organisation units at the same time.</p>

    <p>Dimension tabs listed below "Organisation units" are organisation unit group sets and data element group sets. You are free to add groups from any of these group sets to your chart. Remember to add the group set in either the series, category or filters combobox.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2507"></a>16.9.&nbsp;Selecting additional data dimensions</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Following the organisation unit group sets and data element group sets additional data dimensions which have been configured to be used in analysis are found. Here you can add dimensions such as age, sex, etc. without having to add them in as detailed data element selections. This is useful when you want to separate these categories in your analysis.  </p>

    <p>You can display a chart based on your selections simply by clicking the "Update" button on the top centre menu. This requires that you have selected one or more elements from all of the three dimensions - data (indicators, data elements, reporting rates), periods (relative, fixed) and organisation units (units or groups). Note that "Last 12 Months" from the period dimension and the root organisation unit are selected by default.</p>
    <p>Notice that you can hide and show individual data series in the chart by clicking directly on the series label in the chart - they appear either at the top or to the right of the chart.</p>
    <p>If you want to give the chart more space on your screen you can click on the triple left-arrow button on the top centre menu. This will collapse the left side menu. You can get this menu back by clicking on the same button again.</p>

The file will be automatically downloaded to your computer - for instance can you now embed the image file into a text document as part of a report. You can also download the data source behind the chart in json, xml, csv or Microsoft Excel format.</p>
    <p>For advanced users, two additional options are available under "Advanced". JXRML will produce a template of a Jasper Report which can be further customized based on your exact needs and used as the basis for a standard report in DHIS2. The "Raw data SQL" will provide the actual SQL statement used to generate the data visualization. This could then be used as a data source in a Jasper report, or as the basis for an SQL view</p>

      together with a text expressing some insight about the data. If you want to share a chart
      interpretation you need to first save the chart you want to share as a favorite. Then, without
      making any changes to the chart, click the "Share" button the toolbar. A window will
      open up and this is where you write your interpretation. When you are done, click share button

    <p>You can access the GIS module from the Apps -&gt; GIS link in the top menu. The picture below shows the GIS viewport.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/gis/gis_main.png" align="middle" width="80"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>In the top right corner there is a panel called "Layer overview". If you are online you will see Google Streets and Google Hybrid which can be used as background maps/layers. Switch between the two of them by checking the checkbox. By unchecking the box you can hide the background completely. If you want to see the background, but with reduced opacity, you can set the visibility to something lower than 100% in the numberbox to the right. The final four layers are the vector layers which the user has at his disposal for thematic mapping (explained in the next section). The panels below hold the map legends when you create a thematic map. A legend explains the link between values and colors on your map.</p>
    <p>Lets take a look at the map toolbar. The four icons from the left represent the mentioned vector layers and this is the starting point of the GIS application. Further to the right we have "Favorites": Save your maps to easily restore them later. Saving a map as a favorite also gives you the opportunity of sharing it with other users as an interpretation or put it on the dashboard. "Legend": Create you own legend sets to ensure meaningful maps. "Download": Export the maps as a PNG image. "Share": Share your favorites as map interpretations with other users.</p>
    <p>In the top right corner of the map viewport you find four buttons: "Zoom in", "zoom out", "zoom to visible extent" (automatically adjusts the zoom level and map center position to put the data on your map in focus) and "measure distances".</p>
    <p>The current longitude/latitude position of the mouse cursor is displayed in the bottom right corner of the map viewport.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2599"></a>17.2.&nbsp;Thematic mapping</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>This section describes the four vector layers which the user has at his disposal for thematic mapping: "Event Layer", "Facility layer", "Boundary layer" and "Thematic layer" 1-4.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gisEventMap"></a>17.2.1.&nbsp;Event layer</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/gis/gis_event_layer.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>The purpose of the event layer is to display the geographical location of events
        registered in the DHIS 2 tracker. This layer enables you to drill down from the aggregated
        data displayed in the thematic layers to the underlying individual events or cases. </p>
      <p>To work with this layer, click the event layer icon on the map toolbar and select "Edit
        layer". Select a program and then select a program stage. If there is only one stage
        available for the selected program, the stage will be automatically selected. A list of data
        elements and attributes will appear in the "Available data elements" panel. You are free to
        select and use any data element or attribute from this list as part of your query. To select
        you can either double-click a data element or (multi) select and use the single-arrow
        downward button. The double-arrow button will select all data elements in the list. All
        selected data elements will get their own row in the "Selected data elements". You can also
        use an element multiple times in your query by clicking the + button. For data elements of
        type text you will get two choices: "Contains" implies that the query will match all values
        which contains your search value, and "Is exact" implies that only values which is
        completely identical to your search query will be returned. For data elements of type option
        set, you can select any of the options from the drop down box by using the down-wards arrow
        or by start typing directly in the box to filter for options.</p>
      <p>The event layer also requires you to select the time span for when the events took place
        using the "start date" and "end date" date pickers under the "Periods" section, as well as
        the organisation units to include in the query under the "Organisation units"
        section.</p>
      <p>To get information for an event you can simply click on it. This will open a dialog
        which displays all available information for that event.</p>
      <p>The layer menu also offers to put labels on the map and to close the layer, which completely resets the layer content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gisFacilityMap"></a>17.2.2.&nbsp;Facility layer</h3></div></div></div>

      </div>
      <p>This layer displays icons that represent facilities based on the facility type. Polygons will not show up on the map, so make sure to select an organisation unit level that has facilities. Click an icon on the map to open the context menu with two options. "Show information sheet" provides you with data for several data elements for this organisation unit. The data element group and period type are "system settings" called "Infrastructural data elements" and "Infrastructural period type". The second option in the context menu is "Relocate" and lets you graphically move the organisation unit to a different location. The new coordinate will be stored permanently. Browser cache must be deleted to see the change if you reload the page.</p>
      <p>In the "Edit layer" window will find "surrounding areas" in addition to group set, level
        and parent. This lets you draw a circle around each facility with a desired radius in
        kilometers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gisBoundaryMap"></a>17.2.3.&nbsp;Boundary layer</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <div class="screenshot">

      </div>
      <p>The purpose of the boundary layer is to display the boundaries/coordinates in the
        system. No data will be shown. This layer is useful if you are offline and thus have no
        background map. Click the boundary/globe icon on the toolbar and select "Edit layer". You
        can select the organisation units you want to show on the map by selecting a level and a
        parent. That means "show all organisations units at this level that are children of this
        parent". When there are visible organisation units on the map, you can easily navigate up
        and down in the hierarchy without using the level/parent user interface. By clicking one of
        the organisation units a context menu will open, then select "drill down" or
        "float up". The drill down option will be disabled if you are already on the
        lowest level or if there are no coordinates available on the level below. Vice versa goes
        for floating up.</p>
      <p>The layer menu also offers to put on labels and to locate an organisation unit in the map.</p>
      <p>The final option in the layer menu is "Close". This completely resets the layer content, the edit layer form and the legend panel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gisThematicMap"></a>17.2.4.&nbsp;Thematic layer 1-4</h3></div></div></div>

      </div>
      <p>The four thematic layer panels let you use your data for thematic mapping. All you need to do is selecting your desired combination of indicator/dataelement, period and map combination. Then the organisation unit level and parent to define the boundaries. If your database has coordinates and aggregated data values for these organisation units they will appear on the map. Note that the DHIS2 data mart must be run in order to have aggregated values available.</p>
      <p>You may choose between legend types: <span class="guimenuitem">automatic</span> and <span class="guimenuitem">predefined</span>. Automatic means that the application will create a legend set for you based on your what method, number of classes, low color and high color you select. Method alludes to the size of the legend classes. Set to <span class="guimenuitem">Equal intervals</span> they will be &#8220;highest map value &#8211; lowest map value / number of classes&#8221;. Set to <span class="guimenuitem">Equal group count</span> the legend creator will try to distribute the organisation units evenly. The legend will appear as an even gradation from the start color to the end color. Predefined legend sets are described in  <a class="xref" href="#gisLegendSet" title="17.3.2.&nbsp;Create predefined legend sets">Section&nbsp;17.3.2, &#8220;Create predefined legend sets&#8221;</a> .</p>

      <p>Click the "Legend" button on the map toolbar. To create a new set click the "Add new" button. Example usage (vaccination coverage): Firstly, give the legend set a name. Then create the legends you want in your legend set. The first one could be "Low bad" (name), 0 (start value), 50 (end value), red (color). Click "Add legend" and appears in the list below. Then create "Medium" / 50 / 80 / yellow, "High good" / 80 / 100 / green and finally "Too high" / 100 / 10000 / grey. Now, click the "Create" button in the bottom right corner. If your legend set has overlapping legends (e.g. 0-50 and 40-80) you will not be allowed to proceed. If your legend set has a gap between the legends (e.g. 0-50 and 60-80) you will get a warning, but are allowed to proceed.</p>
      <p>NOTE! Continuous legends are supposed to end and start on the same value, e.g. 0-50 and
        50-80. This will automatically be taken care of by the application. Do not try to do this
        yourself by setting legends to e.g. 0-50 and 51-80. This will cause a usually unwanted gap
        in your legend set.</p>
      <p>You can assign a legend set to an indicator or a data element in the Indicator/Data element module. This legend set will then be automatically selected when such an indicator/data element is selected in the GIS.</p>

    <p>Setting up the GIS simply means storing coordinates for the organisation units you want to show on the map in the database. Coordinates are  often distributed in  proprietary formats and will need to be converted to a format which DHIS2 understands. ESRI shapefiles are the most common geospatial vector data format for desktop applications. You might find shapefiles for your country <a class="ulink" href="http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata" target="_top">here</a> or in many other geospatial data repositories on the web. Some amount of work needs to be done in order to use these coordinates in DHIS 2 GIS, namely transforming the data into a suitable format and ensuring the name which are contained in the geospatial data match exactly with the names of the organization units which they should be matched to. </p>
    <p>If you go to the organisation unit module and edit one of the units, you can see a text field called Coordinates. Here you may fill in its coordinates directly (geojson format) which is useful if you just want to update a couple of units.</p>
    <p>An example point/facility coordinate:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>[29.341,-11.154]</code></strong></pre>
    <p>An example polygon/area coordinates string:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>[[[[29.343,-11.154],[28.329,-11.342],[28.481,-10.239],[29.833,-10.412]]]]</code></strong></pre>
    <p>However, if you are going to e.g. add coordinates for all units at a certain level you don't want to do that manually. This is where the automatic GML import comes into play and the following section explains the preferred way of using it.</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Important"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="resources/images/admon/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>The only co-ordinate reference system supported by DHIS2 is EPSG:4326, also known as
          geographic longitude/latitude. Coordinates must be stored with the longitude (east/west
          position) proceeding the latitude (north/south position). If your vector data is in a
          different CRS than EPSG 4326, you will need to re-project the data first before importing
          into DHIS2. </p>

    <p>Step 1 - Simplify/generalize your geographical data</p>
    <p>The boundaries in geographical data files are usually very accurate, too much so for the
      needs of a web-based GIS. This usually does not affect the performance when using GIS files on
      a local system, but it is usually necessary to optimize the geographical data for the
      web-based GIS system of DHIS2. All geographical data needs to be downloaded from the server
      and rendered in a browser, so if the data is overly complex, the performance of the DHIS2 GIS
      will be negatively impacted. This optimization process can be described as follows:</p>
    <table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>Coordinates: The number of significant decimal digits (e.g. 23.02937874993774) should be shortened to fewer digits (e.g. 23.03). Although this will result in some inaccuracies on the map, given the usual scale at which maps in DHIS2 are produced (&gt; 1:50,000), the loss of precision should not be noticeable. Normally, no more than four significant digits after the decimal point should be necessary.</td></tr><tr><td>Polygons: In addition to shortening the number of significant digits, the actual number of points should also be reduced to an optimal level. Finding this optimal level may take a bit of experimentation. Decreasing the precision of the points as well as the number of points through generalization, will lead to degradation of the polygon. However, after a bit of experimentation, an optimal level of generalization can be found, where the accuracy of the polygon is visually acceptable, and the performance of the GIS is optimal. </td></tr></table>
    <p>For polygons, we need to make the boundary lines less detailed by removing some of the line points. Make a backup of your shapefiles before you start. One possible method is the use of <a class="ulink" href="http://mapshaper.com/test/MapShaper.swf" target="_top">MapShaper</a>   which is an online tool which can be used to generalize geographical data. To use MapShaper, simply upload your shapefile to the site. Then, at the center bottom you see a slider that starts at 0%. It is usually acceptable to drag it up to about 80%. In the left menu you can check "show original lines" to compare the result and you may want to give a different simplification method a try. When you are happy with the result, click "export" in the top right corner. Then check the first of the four options called "Shapefile - polygons", click "create" and wait for the download buttons to appear. Now, download the two files to your local computer and overwrite the existing ones. Move on to the next step with your new simplified shapefile.
    </p>
    <p>Step 2 - Convert the shapefile to GML</p>
    <p>
      The recommended tool for geographical format conversions is called "ogr2ogr". This should be available for most Linux distributions <span class="command"><strong>sudo apt-get install gdal-bin</strong></span>. For Windows, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://fwtools.maptools.org/" target="_top">http://fwtools.maptools.org/ </a>and download "FWTools", install it and open up the FWTools command shell. During the format conversion we also want to ensure that the output has the correct coordinate projection (called EPSG:4326 with geographic longitude and latitude). For a more detailed reference of geographic coordinates, please refer to this <a class="ulink" href="http://www.epsg-registry.org/" target="_top">site</a>.  If you have already reprojected the geographic data to the geographic latitude/longitude (EPSG:4326) system, there is no need to explicitly define the output coordinate system, assuming that <span class="command"><strong>ogr2ogr</strong></span> can determine the input spatial reference system. Note that most shapefiles are using the EPSG:4326 system. You can determine the spatial reference system by executing the following command.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>ogrinfo -al -so filename.shp</code></strong></pre>
    <p>Assuming that the projection is reported to be EPSG:27700 by <span class="command"><strong>ogrinfo</strong></span>, we can transform it to EPSG:4326 by executing the following command.</p><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27700 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f GML filename.gml filename.shp </code></strong></pre>
    <p>If the geographic data is already in EPSG:4326, you can simply transform the shapefile to GML by executing the following command. </p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>ogr2ogr -f GML filename.gml filename.shp</code></strong></pre>
    <p> You will find the created GML file in the same folder as the shapefile.
    </p>
    <p>Step 3 - Prepare the GML file</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the GML file is not ready for importation yet. Open it in a robust text
      editor like Geany (Linux) or Notepad++ (Windows). GML is an XML based format which means that
      you will recognize the regular XML tag hierarchy. In the GML file an organisation unit is
      represented as a &lt;gml:featureMember&gt;. Inside the feature members we usually find a lot
      of attributes, but we are just going to import their coordinates.</p>
    <p>In order to import geospatial data from the feature members of the GML input, DHIS 2 must
      match each of them with an organisation unit in its database. The feature member element must,
      in other words, contain a reference to its corresponding organisation unit. The reference
      itself must be one of three possible DHIS 2 identifiers: <span class="bold"><strong>uid</strong></span>,
        <span class="bold"><strong>code</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>name</strong></span>. The
      identifier of choice must be provided as a property for each feature member element. The
      importer will look for a property with the local name of either <span class="italic">Uid</span>, <span class="italic">Code</span> or <span class="italic">Name</span>, e.g. "ogr:Name" or "anyPrefix:Code".</p>
    <p>If your feature members already contain a property of the identifier you wish to use (such
      as the name of an area) you can use search and replace in a text editor to rename these
      elements to a name DHIS 2 will recognize (see the below table). This is typically a workflow
      which is applicable when using the name as the identifier (the source shapefile or even GML
      will usually contain the name for each area it defines).</p>
    <div class="table"><a name="d5e2741"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;18.1.&nbsp;Organisation unit identifiers supported for GML import</b></p><div class="table-contents">
      
      <table summary="Organisation unit identifiers supported for GML import" border="1"><colgroup><col class="newCol1"><col class="c1"><col class="c2"><col class="c4"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Matching priority</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Valid spellings</th><th>Guaranteed unique</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Uid</td><td>uid, Uid, UID</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Code</td><td>code, Code, CODE</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Name</td><td>name, Name, NAME</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div></div><p><br class="table-break"></p>
    <p>In the case of renaming properties one would usually find a tag named something like
      "ogr:DISTRICT_NAME", "ogr:NAME_1" and rename it to "ogr:Name".
      If using the <span class="italic">code</span> or <span class="italic">uid</span>
      identifiers on the other hand, looking up the correct values in the DHIS 2 database and going
      through the GML file, adding the properties for each corresponding feature member might be
      necessary. In any of the cases it is important to realize that the identifier used must
        <span class="bold"><strong>uniquely</strong></span> identify an organisation unit (e.g. if there are
      two organisation units in the database of the same name or code, these cannot be matched
      properly on either). As <span class="italic">uid</span> is the only
      guaranteed-to-be-unque identifier it is the most robust choice. However, as matching on name
      is usually easier (given that the name is already part of your data), a viable approach to
      solving uniqueness conflicts can be to match any non-uniquely named organisation units on a
      different identifier (uid, preferrably) and the rest on their names.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in the above table there is a matching priority, meaning is any two or more
      identifiers are provided for the same feature member, matching will be performed on the
      highest priority identifier. Note also the valid properties which can be used in you GML. The
      namespace prefix is not important as only the local name is used.</p>
    <p>A common pitfall of performing preparation of the GML files is syntax- or element naming
      errors. Therefore please make sure that all properties of the GML file are started and
      terminated with correctly corresponding tags. Also make sure the properties follow either of
      the given valid spellings of the property name. The identifying properties are supposed to
      look like e.g. &lt;ogr:Name&gt;Moyamba District&lt;/ogr:Name&gt;,
      &lt;somePrefix:uid&gt;x7uuia898nJ&lt;/somePrefix:uid&gt; or &lt;CODE&gt;OU_12345&lt;/CODE&gt;.
      Another common error is not making sure the identifier matches exactly, especially when using
      the <span class="italic">name</span> property. All matches are performed on exact
      values, meaning that "Moyamba" in a source GML file would not be matched against
      "Moyamba District" in the database.</p>
    <p>Have a brief look at the identifiers and compare them to the corresponding values in the
      database. If they seem to match fairly good, it is about time to do a preview in the
      import-export module. </p>
    <p>
      Go to Services -&gt; Import-Export, select "Preview", select the GML file and click "Import". Look for new/updated organisation units. Our intention is to add coordinates to already existing organisation units in the database, so we want as many updates as possible and 0 new. Those listed as new will be created as root units and mess up the organisation unit trees in DHIS 2. If any listed as new, click the number and the organisation units in question will appear in the list below. If there are any slight misspellings compared to the organisation unit names in the database - fix them and do the preview again. Otherwise, click the "discard all" button below the list and then the "Import all" button above the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the import process completes successfully, you should now be able to utilize the geographical data in the DHIS2 GIS. If not, check the log for hints and look for common errors such as:    
    </p>
    <p>- Name duplicates in the GML file. The name column in the database is unique and does not accept two organisation units with the same name.</p>
    <p>- The "shortname" column in the organisationunit table in your database has a too
      small varchar definition. Increase it to 100.</p>
    <p>- Special name characters in the GML file. Be sure to convert these to appropriate XML
      equivalents or escape sequences.</p>
    <p>- Wrongly formatted input GML, non-matching tags</p>

      <p>In the bigger picture of HIS terminology all data in DHIS are usually called aggregated as they are aggregates (e.g. monthly summaries) of medical records or some kind of service registers reported from the health facilities. Aggregation inside DHIS however, which is the topic here, is concerned with how the raw data captured in DHIS (through data entry or import)are further aggregated over time (e.g. from monthly to quarterly values) or up the organisational hierarchy (e.g. from facility to district values).

          <p>Data (raw) can be registered at any organisational level, e.g. at national hospital
            at level 2, a health facility at level 5, or at a bigger PHC at level 4. This varies
            form country to country, but DHIS is flexible in allowing data entry or data import to
            take place at any level. This means that orgunits that themselves have children can
            register data, sometimes the same data elements as their children units. The basic rule
            of aggregation in DHIS 2 is that <span class="emphasis"><em>all raw data is aggregated
              together</em></span>, meaning data registered at a facility on level 5 is added to the
            data registered for a PHC at level 4.</p>
          <p>
It is up to the user/system administrator/designer to make sure that no duplication of data entry is taking place and that e.g. data entered at level 4 are not about the same services/visits that are reported by orgunit children at level 5. NOTE that in some cases you want to have duplication of data in the system, but in a controlled manner. E.g. when you have two different sources of data for population estimates, both level 5 catchment population data and another population data source for level 4 based on census data (because sum of level 5 catchments is not always the same as level 4 census data). Then you can specify using advanced aggregation settings (see further down) that the system should e.g. not add level 5 population data to the level 4 population data, and that level 3,2,1 population data aggregates are only based on level 4 data and does not include level 5 data.</p>

          <p>How data is aggregated depends on the dimension of aggregation (see further down).</p>
          <p>Along the orgunit level dimension data is always summed up, simply added together. Note that raw data is never percentages, and therefore can be summed together. Indicator values that can be percentages are treated differently (re-calculated at each level, never summed up).</p>
          <p>
Along the time dimension there are several possibilities, the two most common ways to aggregate are sum and average. The user can specify for each data element which method to use by setting the aggregation operator (see further down). Monthly service data are normally summed together over time, e.g. the number of vaccines given in a year is the sum of the vaccines given for each month of that year. For population, equipment, staff and other kind of what is often called semi-permanent data the average method is often the one to use, as, e.g. 'number of nurses' working at a facility in a year would not be the sum of the two numbers reported in the six-monthly staffing report, but rather the average of the two numbers. More details further down under 'aggregation operators'.

          <p>Organisational units are used to represent the 'where' dimension associated with data values. In DHIS 2, organisational units are arranged in a hierarchy, which typically corresponds to the hierarchical nature of the organisation or country. Organisational unit levels correspond to the distinct levels within the hierarchy. For instance, a country may be organized into provinces, then districts, then facilities, and then sub-centers. This organisational hierarchy would have five levels. Within each level, a number of organisational units would exist. During the aggregation process, data is aggregated from the lower organisational unit levels to higher levels. Depending on the aggregation operator, data may be 'summed' or 'averaged' within a given organisational unit level, to derive the aggregate total for all the organisational units that are contained within a higher level organisational unit level. For instance, if there are ten districts contained in a province and the aggregation operator for a given data element has been defined as 'SUM',  the aggregate total for the province would be calculated as the sum of the values of the individual ten districts contained in that province.</p>

          <p>Periods are used to represent the 'when' dimension associated with data values. Data can easily be aggregated from weeks to months, from months to quarters, and from quarters to years. DHIS 2 uses known rules of how these different intervals are contained within other intervals (for instance Quarter 1 2010 is known to contain January 2010, February 2010 an March 2010) in order to aggregate data from smaller time intervals, e.g. weeks, into longer time intervals, e.g. months. </p>

          <p>The data element dimension specifies 'what' is being recorded by a particular data value. Data element categories are actually degenerated dimensions of the data element dimension, and are used to disaggregate the data element dimension into finer categories. Data element categories, such as 'Age' and 'Gender', are used to record a particular data element, typically for different population groups. These categories can then be used to calculate the overall total for the category  and the total of all categories. </p>

          <p>The 'sum' operator simply calculates the sum of all data values that are contained within a particular aggregation matrix. For instance, if data is recorded on a monthly basis at the district level and is aggregated to provincial quarterly totals, all data contained in all districts for a given province and all weeks for the given quarter will be added together to obtain the aggregate total.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e2835"></a>19.1.1.4.2.&nbsp;Average</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>When the average aggregation operator is selected, the unweighted average of all data values within a given aggregation matrix are calculated. </p>
          <p>It is important to understand how DHIS 2 treats null values in the context of the
            average operator. It is fairly common for some organisational units not to submit data
            for certain data elements. In the context of the average operator, the average results
            from the number of data elements that are actually present (therefore NOT NULL) within a
            given aggregation matrix. If there are 12 districts within a given province, but only 10
            of these have submitted data, the average aggregate will result from these ten values
            that are actually present in the database, and will not take into account the missing
            values. </p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e2841"></a>19.1.1.5.1.&nbsp;Aggregation levels</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>The normal rule of the system is to aggregate all raw data together when moving up the organisational hierarchy, and the system assumes that data entry is not being duplicated by entering the same services provided to the same clients at both facility level and also entering an 'aggregated' (sum of all facilities) number at a higher level. This is to more easily facilitate aggregation when the same services are provided but to different clients/catchment populations at facilities on level 5 and a PHC (the parent of the same facilities) at level 4. In this way a facility at level 5 and a PHC at level 4 can share the same data elements and simply add together their numbers to provide the total of services provided in the geographical area.</p>
          <p>Sometimes such an aggregation is not desired, simply because it would mean duplicating data about the same population. This is the case when you have two different sources of data for two different orgunit levels. E.g. catchment population for facilities can come from a different source than district populations and therefore the sum of the facility catchment populations do not match the district population provided by e.g. census data. If this is the case we would actually want duplicated data in the system so that each level can have as accurate numbers as possible, but then we do NOT want to aggregate these data sources together.
</p>
          <p>In the Data Element section you can edit data elements and for each of them specify how aggregation is done for each level. In the case described above we need to tell the system NOT to include facility data on population in any of the aggregations above that level, as the level above, in this case the districts have registered their population directly as raw data. The district population data should then be used at all levels above and including the district level, while facility level should use its own data.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e2846"></a>19.1.1.5.2.&nbsp;How to edit data element aggregation</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>This is controlled through something called aggregation levels and at the end of the edit data element screen there is a tick-box called Aggregation Levels. If you tick that one you will see a list of aggregation levels, available and selected. Default is to have no aggregation levels defined, then all raw data in the hierarchy will be added together. To specify the rule described above, and given a hierarchy of Country, Province, District, Facility: select Facility and District as your aggregation levels. Basically you select where you have data. Selecting Facility means that Facilities will use data from facilities (given since this is the lowest level). Selecting District means that the District level raw data will be used when aggregating data for District level (hence no aggregation will take place at that level), and the facility data will not be part of the aggregated District values. When aggregating data at Province level the District level raw data will be used since this is the highest available aggregation level selected. Also for Country level aggregates the District raw data will be used. Just to repeat, if we had not specified that District level was an aggregation level, then the facility data and district data would have been added together and caused duplicate (double) population data for districts and all levels above.</p>

      <p>Resource tables provide additional information about the dimensions of the data in a
        format that is well suited for external tools to combine with the data value table. By
        joining the data value table with these resource tables one can easily aggregate along the
        data element category dimension or data element/indicator/organisation unit groups
        dimensions. E.g. by tagging all the data values with the category option male or female and
        provide this in a separate column 'gender' one can get subtotals of male and
        female based on data values that are collected for category option combinations like (male,
        &lt;5) and (male,&gt;5). See the Pivot Tables section for more examples of how these can be
        used. orgunitstructure is another important table in the database that helps to provide the
        hierarchy of orgunits together with the data. By joining the orgunitstructure table with the
        data values table you can get rows of data values with the full hierarchy, e.g. on the form:
        OU1, OU2, OU3, OU4, DataElement, Period, Value (Sierra Leone, Bo, Badija, Ngelehun CHC, BCG
        &lt;1, Jan-10, 32) This format makes it much easier for e.g. pivot tables or other OLAP
        tools to aggregate data up the hierarchy. </p>

      <p>Report tables are defined, cross-tabulated reports which can be used as the basis of further reports, such as Excel Pivot Tables or simply downloaded as an Excel sheet. Report tables are intended to provide a specific view of data which is required, such as "Monthly National ANC Indicators". This report table might provide all ANC indicators for a country, aggregated by month for the entire country.  This data could of course be retrieved from the main datamart, but report tables generally perform faster and present well defined views of data to users. </p>

    <p>To create a new report table, go to the Report tables section of the Reports module (Reports -&gt; Report Table). Above the list of standard reports, use the "Add report table" or "Add Dataelement Dimension Table" buttons. A regular report table can be used to hold data on data elements, indicators or dataset completeness, while Dataelement  dimension tables are used to include data element categories in report tables. Creating the tables are done in the same way, however, the only exception being when choosing data.</p>
    <p>To create a report table, you start by making some general choices for the table, the most important of which is the crosstab dimension. Then, you choose which data elements, indicators,  datasets or data element dimensions you want to include. Finally you select which organisation units and time periods to use in the report table. Each of these steps are described in detail below.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2859"></a>19.2.1.&nbsp;General options</h3></div></div></div>

      </div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Cross tab dimensions</strong></span></p>
      <p>You can cross-tab one or more of the following dimensions: data element/indicator, orgunit, and period, which means that columns will be created based on the values of the dimensions chosen, e.g. if indicators is selected you will get column names in the table reflecting the names of the selected indicators. </p>
      <p>
For example, if you cross-tab on indicators and periods, the column headers will say "&lt;indicator title&gt; &lt;period&gt;". The organisation units will be listed as rows. See screenshot for clarification:
</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/crosstab_ind-per.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>
If you cross-tab on indicators and organisation units, the column headers of the table will say "&lt;indicator title&gt; &lt;organisation unit&gt;". Now the periods will be listed as rows. See screenshot for clarification:
</p>
      <div class="screenshot">

      </div>
      <p>Note that the options made here regarding crosstab dimensions may have consequences for what options are available when using the report table as a data source later, for example for standard reports.</p>

      <p>Affects the rightmost column in the table, allows you to choose to sort it low to high or high to low.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Top limit</strong></span></p>
      <p>Top limit allow you to set a maximum number of rows you want to include in the report table.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Include regression</strong></span></p>
      <p>This adds additional columns with regression values that can be included in the report design, e.g. in line charts.</p>

      </div>
      <p>There are two ways to select both what organisation units to include in a report, and what time periods should be included: relative, or fixed. Fixed organisation units and/or periods means that you select the units/periods to include in the report table when you create the report table. Using relative periods, you can select the time and/or units as parameters when the report table is populated, for example when running a standard report or creating a chart. A combination is also possible, for example to add some organisation units in the report permanently while letting the users choose additional. Report parameters is discussed below. In general, using fixed organisation units and/or time periods are an unnecessary restriction.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Fixed Organisation Units</strong></span></p>
      <p>To add fixed organisation units, click "Toggle fixed organisation units". A panel will appear where  you can choose orgunits to always include in the report. If you leave it blank,  the users select orgunits when running the report through the use of  report parameters. Use the drop down menu to filter organisation units by level, double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Fixed Periods</strong></span></p>
      <p>To add fixed periods, click "Toggle fixed organisation units". A panel will appear where  you can choose periods to always include in the report. If you leave it blank,  the users select periods when running the report through the use of  report parameters. Use the drop down menu to choose period type (week, month, etc), the Prev and Next button to choose year,  and double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Relative periods</strong></span></p>
      <p>Instead of using fixed/static periods like 'Jan-2010' or 'Q1-2010', more generic periods can be used to create reusable report tables, e.g. for monthly reports the period 'Reporting month' will simply pick the current reporting month selected by the user when running the report. Note that all relative periods are relative to a "reporting month". The reporting month is  either selected by the users, otherwise the current month is used. Here is a description of the possible relative periods:

</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Reporting month:</span></p>
          <p>Use this for monthly reports. The month selected in the reporting month parameter will be used in the report.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Months/Quarters this year</span>: </p>
          <p>This will provide one value per month or quarter in the year. This is well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have no data will be empty, but will always keep the same column name.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">This year:</span> </p>
          <p>This is the cumulative so far in the year, aggregating the periods from the beginning of the year up to and including the selected reporting month.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Months/Quarters last year</span>: </p>
          <p>This will provide one value per month or quarter last year, relative to the reporting month. This is well suited for standard monthly or quarterly reports where all month/quarters need to be listed. Periods that still have no data will be empty, but will always keep the same column name.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Last year:</span> </p>
          <p>This is the cumulative last year, relative to the reporting month, aggregating all the periods from last year.
</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Example - relative periods</strong></span></p>
      <p>Let's say we have chosen three indicators: A, B and C, and we have also chosen to use the relative periods 'Reporting month' and 'This year' when we created the report table. If the reporting month (selected automatically or by the user) is for example May 2010, the report table will calculate the values for the three selected indicators for May 2010 (= the 'Reporting month') and the accumulated values for the three selected indicators so far in 2010 (= so far 'This year').</p>
      <p>Thus, we will end up with six values for each of the organisation units: "Indicator A May 2010", "Indicator B May 2010" "Indicator C May 2010", "Indicator A so far in 2010", "Indicator B so far in 2010" and "Indicator C so far in 2010".</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Report parameters</strong></span></p>
      <p>Report parameters make the reports more generic and reusable over time and for different organisation units. These parameters will pop up when generating the report table or running a report based on the report table. The users will select what they want to see in the report. There are four possible report parameters, and you can select none, all, or any combination.</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Reporting month:</span> </p>
          <p>This decides which month will be used when the system is choosing the relative periods. If the box it not checked, the user will not be asked for the reporting month when the report is generated - the current month will then be used.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Grand parent organisation unit:</span> </p>
          <p>Select the grand parent of all the orgunit children and grand children you want listed in the report. E.g. a selected region will trigger the use of the region itself, all its district, and all their sub-districts.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Parent organisation unit:</span> </p>
          <p>Select the parent of all the orgunit children you want listed in the report. E.g. a selected district will trigger the use of the district itself and all its children/sub-districts.
</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="italic">Organisation unit:</span> </p>
          <p>This triggers the use of this orgunit in the report. No children are listed.
</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Example - report parameters</strong></span></p>
      <p>Continuing with the example on relative periods just above, let's say that in addition to 'Reporting month', we have chosen  'Parent organisation unit' as a report parameter when we created the report table. When we're running the report table, we will be asked to select an organisation unit. Now, let's say we choose "Region R" as the organisation unit. "Region R" has the children "District X" and "District Y".</p>
      <p>When the report is run, the system will aggregate data for both "District X" and "District Y". The data will be aggregated from the lowest level where they have been collected. The values for the districts will be aggregated further to give an aggregated value for "Region R".</p>
      <p>Thus, the report table will generate the six values presented in the previous example, for "District X", "District Y" and "Region R".</p>

      <p>These tables enable the use of data element categories in report tables. There are two differences from regular report tables. The first is that it is not possible to select crosstab dimensions, as the columns will always be the disaggregations from the category combinations. The other is the actual choice of data. Only one category combination can be added per report, and only data elements from the same category combo can be selected. </p>
      <p>Subtotals and the total will also be included in the table, e.g. a gender (male, female) + EPI age(&lt;1, &gt;1) category combo would give the following columns:
male+&lt;1, male+&gt;1, Female+&lt;1, female+&gt;1, male, female,&lt;1, &gt;1, total.

      <p>To make the report tables reusable over time and across orgunits they can have  parameters. Four types of parameters are allowed; orgunit, parent orgunit (for listing of orgunits in one area), grand parent orgunit and reporting month. As a side note it can be mentioned that we are looking into expanding this to include reporting quarter and year, or to make that period parameter more generic with regard to period type somehow. The ability to use period as a parameter makes the report table reusable over time and as such fits nicely with report needs such as monthly, quarterly or annual reports. When a report is run by the user in DHIS 2, the user must specify the values for the report tables that are linked to the report. First the report table is re-generated (deleted and re-created with updated data), and then the report is run (in the background, in Jasper report engine).

</p>
      <p>Report tables can consist of  values related to data elements, indicators or data completeness, which is related to completeness of reporting across orgunits for a given month. Completeness reports will be covered in a separate section.</p>
      <p>There are three dimensions in a report table that identify the data; indicators or data elements, orgunits and periods. For each of these dimensions the user can select which metadata values to include in the report. The user must select one or more data elements or indicators to appear in the report. The orgunit selection can be substituted with a parameter, either one specific orgunit or an orgunit parent (making itself and all its children appear in the report). If one or more orgunits are selected and no orgunit parameter is used, then the report is static with regard to which orgunits to include, which in most cases is an unnecessary restriction to a report.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Using relative periods</strong></span></p>
      <p>The period selection is more advanced as it can in addition to specific periods like Jan-09, Q1-08, 2007 also contain what is called relative periods. As report usually is run routinely over time a specific period like Jan-09 is not very useful in a report. Instead, if you want to design a monthly report, you should use the relative period called Reporting Month. Then you must also include Reporting Month as one of your report parameters to let the system know what exactly is the Reporting Month on the time of report generation. There are many other relative periods available, and they all relate to the report parameter Reporting Month. E.g. the relative period called So far this year refers to the accumulative value for the year incl. the Reporting Month. If you want a trend report with multiple periods in stead of one aggregated period, you can select e.g. 'Months this year', which would give you values for each month so far in the year. You can do a similar report with quarters. The idea is to support as many generic report types as possible using relative periods, so if you have other report needs, please suggest new relative periods on the mailing list, and they might be added to the report table options.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Cross-tabbing dimensions</strong></span></p>
      <p>Cross tabbing is a very powerful functionality in report design, as the typical DHIS 2 data table with references to period, data element/indicator and orgunit makes more advanced report design very difficult, as you cannot put e.g. specific indicators, periods or orgunits on specific columns. E.g. by cross-tabbing on the indicator dimension in an indicator report table you will get the indicator names on the column headers in your report, in addition to a column referencing orgunit, and another column referencing period. With such a table design you could drag and drop indicator names to specific columns or chart positions in the iReport software. Similarly you can cross tab on orgunits or periods to make their names specifically available to report design. E.g. by cross-tabbing on periods and selecting the two relative periods 'Reporting month' and 'This year', you can design reports with both the last month and the accumulative annual value for given month as they will be available as column headers in your report table. It is also possible to combine two dimensions in cross-tabbing, e.g. period and indicator, which makes it possible to e.g. look at three selected indicators for two specific relative periods. This would e.g. make it possible to make a table or chart based report with BCG, DPT3 and Measles coverage, both for the last month and the accumulative coverage so far in the year. 

</p>
      <p>All in all, by combining the functionality of cross tabbing, relative periods and report table parameters you should have a tool to support most report scenarios. If not, we would be very happy to receive suggestions to further improvements to report tables. As already mentioned, we have started to look at more fine-grained parameters for the period dimension as the 'Reporting month' does not cover enough, or at least is not intuitive enough, when it comes to e.g. quarterly reports.

When the report table is run, the system will calculate values for specified indicators/data elements/data sets, orgunits and periods. The data will be presented in DHIS 2 in a table layout. The column headers will correspond to the cross-tab dimension you have selected. An example report table showing ANC coverage for a district in The Gambia, is shown below. Here the indicator and the periods are cross-tabbed, as can be seen from the column headers.

      <p>A standard report is a manually designed report that presents data in a manually
        specified layout. Standard reports can be based either on report tables or SQL queries. Both
        approaches are described in the following sections. The main advantage of using report
        tables is that of simplicity - no special development skills are required. In cases where
        you have special requirements or need to utilize additional parts of the DHIS database you
        might want to use a SQL based standard report. In any case you will be able to utilize
        report parameters in order to create dynamic reports. The following guide will use the
        report table approach, while the SQL approach is covered towards the end.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3040"></a>19.4.2.&nbsp;Designing Standard reports in iReport</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Jasper iReport Designer is a tool for creating reports that can be used as Standard Reports in DHIS 2. The tool allows for the creation of standard report templates that can easily be exported from DHIS 2 with up to date data. The process of creating reports involves four major steps:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>A report table must be created in DHIS 2 with the indicators/data elements/datasets to be used in the report.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>You have to run the report table and download the design file (Click the "Download as JRXML" button).</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Open the downloaded .jrxml file using the free software Jasper iReport Designer to edit the layout of the report.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>The edited report can then be uploaded to DHIS 2 to be used as a standard report.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>If you want to preview your report during the design in iReport, you actually have to upload your file to DHIS 2 to see how it looks.</p>
      <p>These four steps will be describe in detail in the coming sections. In general, when you are making standard reports you should have a clear idea of how it should look before you even make the report table, as how the report table is designed has implications for how the report can be formatted in iReport. For example, what crosstab dimensions are selected in the report table has consequences for what crosstabs are available for the standard report, and it has consequences for what types of charts you can make.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note: If you have not created a report table yet, you have to do so. See section "How to create report tables" to do so.</em></span></p>
        <p>Locate your desired report table and run it by clicking the green circle with a white arrow inside. When the report is shown, click the "Download as JRXML" button to download the design file. Then open that file in the Jasper iReport Designer software.</p>

      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e3059"></a>19.4.2.2.&nbsp;Editing the report</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>You are now ready to edit the layout of the report. The main iReport window consists of a "Report Inspector" to the left, the report document in the middle, a "Palette" area on the upper right hand side and a "Properties" area on the lower right hand side. The "Report Inspector" are used for selecting and examining the various properties of the report, and when selecting an item in the inspector, the "Properties" panel changes to display properties relating to the selection. The "Palette" is used for adding various elements, e.g. text boxes, images and charts to the document.  
</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireport/iReport-window.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note: If you cannot see the Palette or Properties sidebar, you can enable them from the menu item called "Window" on the menu bar.</em></span></p>
        <p>The iReport document is divided into seven main bands, divided by layout separators (the blue lines). These lines are used to decide how big each of the areas should be on the report. 
</p>
        <p>The areas all have different purposes:
</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Title - area for the title of the report</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Page header - area for the page header</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Column header - area for column headers (for the table)</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Detail 1 - area where the actual report data will be placed</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Column footer - area to make footer of the table</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Page footer - area for the page footer</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Summary - elements in this area will be placed at the end of the report</p>
          </li></ul></div>
        <p>By default you will see that only the Title, Column Header and the Detail 1 bands have
          data. For most reports this is OK. The Title band is suitable for a title and e.g. a
          chart. Data fields entered into the Detail 1 area will be iterated over to create a table.
          For example, if a field called "dataelementname" is placed in the Detail 1 band,
          all data elements in the report table will be listed here. We'll come back to data
          fields management just a little below.</p>
        <p>The unused bands in the report are shrinked to add more space for your report data. You can
        however increase/decrease the band height as you like. There are two ways to do that. The first way is simply to drag the blue band-line as shown below.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="66%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireport/17_drag.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>The other way to adjust the band height is to select a band in the 
        "Report Inspector", and then adjust the "Band height" value in the 
        "Detail 1 - properties" area in the lower right corner.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireport/18_adjust.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>As the fields are already present on the report, you probably don't want to do anything
        than just fix the layout and drag fields around. You can also resize the fields by dragging the side, top or bottom lines. If you want to change the text in the column headers, you simply double click the field and change the text.</p>
        <p>To add the a field to the table, we simply drag it to the Detail 1 band from the "Report Inspector". The column header will be added automatically.</p>
        <p>By double clicking the box, the text can be edited. The format of the text, such as size, font and alignment, can be adjusted with the tools above the document.</p>

        <p>
   There are two types of text in iReport: &laquo;Text labels&raquo; and &laquo;Text fields&raquo; (data fields). They work in different ways, and should be used for different purposes. The main point is that text fields are just placeholders that will be filled with the correct text from the report table when the report is run, while text labels will stay the way they are when the report is run.</p>

          <p>Static text are text plain text labels that can be edited normally. There are two ways to edit text labels: </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

          <p>Text fields are formulas that will be filled from the report table when the report is run. Unlike static text, these can not be edited in a normal way. However, they can be manipulated in various ways to ensure that the desired output will be produced. There are three ways to edit the text fields:</p>
          <p></p>
          <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

            </li><li class="listitem">
              <p>By using the Text field properties in the Properties panel</p>
            </li></ul></div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="30%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_04.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

          </div>
          <p>Text fields can represent either numbers or text, so that they can be used both for
            showing for example names of district or for numeric values. It is therefore important
            the Expression class, seen in the Text field properties matches the Text field
            expression. For the default text fields in the .jrxml file downloaded from DHIS 2 this
            is not a problem, but it is important when making new text fields. The two most
            important Expression classes are java.lang.Double for numbers and java.lang.String for
            text.</p>

            <p>For example, let us say you have a quarterly report where you would like to add a new column with the yearly total. You therefore add a new Static text field to the column header band, and a Text field to the details band in. By default, new Text fields are set to java.lang.String (text). However, the yearly total column will be filled with numbers. We therefore have to change the Expression class for the new text field to java.lang.Double:</p>

            <p>When we edit the text field expression, we see the Expression editor window with all the available columns from the report table. We can see here that each of these are marked with what type they are - text or number. What we need to make sure of is therefore that the expression class we choose for the text field matches the actual expression.</p>

        <p>In the default table exported from DHIS 2, there are some rows that it might be better to leave out of the table, and some that it would be preferable to have at the end. For example, when making a table based on a report table with the &laquo;parent organisation unit&raquo; parameter, the default table might have a row with the national level somewhere in between all the regions. In iReport, this can be changed so that the &laquo;parent organisation unit&raquo; appears at the bottom of the table. This involves two steps that will be explained below. Note that this will not work where there is only one organisation units, and it is therefore most useful when using the &laquo;parent organisation unit&raquo; or &laquo;grand parent organisation unit&raquo; parameters in the report table.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e3175"></a>19.4.2.4.1.&nbsp;Hiding the &laquo;parameter organisation unit&raquo; from the table</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>We exclude the "parameter organisation unit" from the table by using a
            property in the Details band called "Print when expression". To set a Print
            when expression, start by selecting the Detail band in the Report inspector, then edit
            the Print when expression in the properties panel.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_11.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

          </div>
          <p>The Expression editor window should now appear. What we must do is to create an expression that checks if the row being generated is the row with the organisation unit given as a parameter. The report table contains a column that we can use for this called organisation_unit_is_parent. To exclude the row with the parameter organisation unit, double click on organisation_unit_is_parent in the list to copy it to the expression area, then add <span class="command"><strong>.equals("No")</strong></span> at the end so that the code is:</p>
          <p><span class="command"><strong>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("No")</strong></span></p>
          <p>This tells the report engine to only print table rows where the organisation unit is not the parent organisation unit.</p>

          <p>Instead of removing the "param organisation unit" from the table entirely, it is also possible to put it at the bottom (or top) of the table. This is done by using the sort functionality explained in the next section, and choosing to sort first by "organisation_unit_is_parent". Other sorting options can be added in addition to this, for example to make a list where the param organisation unit is at the bottom of the table, with the other organisation units listed alphabetically above it.

          <p>Using the expression editor it is also possible to exclude other rows from the table, in addition to the parent organisation unit as was explained above. In Ghana, for example, all regions have a &laquo;fake district&raquo; which is the name of the region in square brackets. This can also be excluded from the table using the Print when expression that was introduced above. To to this, follow the instructions above to bring up the Expression editor window. Then, we use Java expressions to test whether or not the row should be hidden.</p>

            <p><span class="command"><strong>($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != '[')</strong></span></p>
            <p>This makes the report skip any rows where the first character of the organisation unit name is [.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to combine several of these expressions. To do this we put the expressions in a parenthesis with the two characters &amp;&amp; in between. For example, to make a table that leaves both organisation units whose name starts with [ and the parent organisation unit, we can use the following expression:</p>
            <p><span class="command"><strong>($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != '[')&amp;&amp;$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("No")</strong></span></p>

        <p>Often you will be making reports where the first column is organisation unit names. However, it can be a problem that the list of organisation units are not sorted alphabetically. This can be fixed in iReport through a few simple steps.</p>

        <p>By default, the reports from DHIS 2 uses the short names for indicators and data elements in reports and charts. In some cases these are not always very meaningful for third parties, but with some work they can be given custom names through iReport. This is useful for example if you are making a report with indicators as rows and periods as column, or for charts with indicators. </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_000.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>To change the names of an indicator or data element, we have to edit its &laquo;expression&raquo; or formula, for example by right clicking the text box and choosing Edit expression to bring up the Expression editor. </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_32.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>Next, we have to insert some Java code. In the following example, we will be replacing the shortname of three indicators with their proper names. The code searches for the shortname, and then replaces it with a proper name. </p>
        <div class="screenshot">

          </li></ul></div>
        <p>Each line has the same format, where the red text is the shortname, the blue text is what we want to insert instead.</p>

        <p>By using the expression editor, it is possible to add a column to the table with totals for each row. In the following example, we will make a table with three months as columns as well as a column with the totals for the three months.</p>
        <p>We start by dragging a text label into the table header and changing its text to "Total", and dragging a text field into the details row. </p>
        <p>As was discussed in the section on "Text field", we have to change the properties of the new text field so that it can display numbers. To do this, change the "Expressions Class" in the properties panel to "java.lang.Double".</p>
        <p>Right click the text field and choose "Edit Expression". This will bring up the "Expressions editor".  As the expression, we want to sum up all the columns. In this case we have three value expressions we want to sum up: "September", "October 2010", "November 2010". The name of these fields will vary depending on the crosstab dimension you have chosen in the report table. In our case, the  expression we make is  "$f{September}+$f{October 2010}+$f{November 2010}":</p>
        <p>Each row of the table have a totals column to the right.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e3301"></a>19.4.2.8.&nbsp;Groups of tables</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>There are cases when it can be useful to have several tables in one report. This can be done using Report groups. Using this functionality, one can for example create a report one table for each indicator, or one table of each organisation unit. In the following, we will go through the steps needed to make a report with three indicators, each represented in one table. It is important that the report table does not crosstab on indicators when we want to make groups of tables based on indicators. </p>
        <p>In our example, the .jrxml file downloaded from DHIS 2 will by default have one column for organisation unit and on for indicators (assuming we have chosen periods as the only crosstab dimension). We start by removing the indicator column, since this in not needed in our case, and realign the other fields to fit the report.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_36.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>Next, we create out Report group. Go to the report inspector, right click on the
          report name (dpt is the default) and choose Add Report Group. </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_38.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>A window will appear, with a report group wizard. Select a name for the group, in this case we choose &laquo;Indicator&raquo;. In the drop down menu, we can select what columns in the report table we want the groups to be based on. So, if we wanted one table for each organisation unit, we would choose organisation unit name as the report object to group according to. However, since we are grouping by indicators in this example, we choose indicatorname. Then click next. </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_39.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>The next step is to select whether or not we want a separate Group header and Group footer band for each report group. In this case, we choose to include both. Click Finish, and the group bands should appear in the report.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_40.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>If you upload and run the report, it will now create one table for each indicator. However, it will not look very good as there will be no header row over each table - only one header at the top of each page. Also, there is no indication as to which table is showing which indicator. In the following, we will fix this.</p>
        <p>Instead of having the title row in the column header, we can instead move it to the Group header. This will make the heading show up above each individual table. Furthermore, we can add a heading to each table with the name of the indicator. </p>
        <p>Move the column headers from the Column header band to the Indicator group header band.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_41.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div>
        <p>Next, add a text field to the Indicator group heading band, and edit it&#8217;s expression to display the indicator name.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_42.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

        </div>
        <p>The report should now have three tables, one for each indicator. Each table will have a heading with the name of the indicator, and also a table header row.</p>

          <p>When using grouping, some precautions must be taken with regards to sorting. Notably, when adding sorting parameters, whatever parameter is used as basis for the grouping must come first. Thus if you are grouping the report by indicator, and want sort the organisation units alphabetically, you have to choose to sort first by indicator, then by organisation unit name as shown below.

        <p>By default, a 3D bar chart is included in the .jrxml file that is downloaded from DHIS
          2. This is set up so that only data from the &laquo;parameter organisation unit&raquo; (often the
          parent or grand parent) is used. Usually, this is a good solution. Since it is the
          default, we will start by looking at bar charts, before looking at line charts.</p>

          <p>Bar charts are the default chart type in DHIS 2. In this section, we will look at
            how to make a bar charts like the one above, comparing the value of one indicator in

          <p>A window will appear. By default, the Filter expression is filled in so that only data for the parent organisation unit will be displayed. If for some reason you do not want this, simply delete the text in the text box. In this case we do NOT want the filter, as we are making a chart showing a comparison across districts.

            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_500.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>The first box is a text field where the name of the series can be inserted or edited. This is the field that will be used to fill the text in the legend box (shown below).</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="15%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_50.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>However, if you want to have the name of each bar along the x-axis of the chart instead of using the legend, this can be done by adding whatever text you want to present in the Category expression field, or by inserting an expression to have it filled automatically when the report is run. In this case, we want to have one bar for each organisation unit. We therefore edit the category expression by clicking on the button to the right.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_49.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>As the expression, we chose organisationunitname, as shown below.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_490.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>When we are finished, the series editor should look like below. Click OK, then Close to close the Chart Details window.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">

          </div>
          <p>If you add a good description in the Category expression area, you can leave out the legend box. This is done in the Report properties panel of iReport, where you can also edit many other details of the chart.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">

          </div>
          <p>We can also add a title to the chart, for example the name of the indicator. This is also done in the Chart properties panel, under Title expression.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_55.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>The Expression editor window will appear, where you can enter the title. Note that the title must be in quotes, as shown below.</p>

          <p>The chart is now ready.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e3438"></a>19.4.2.9.2.&nbsp;Line charts</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>Line charts can be useful in many circumstances. However, to make line charts the report data (report table) must be suited for it. Thus if you want to make a line chart, it is important that the report table does not have periods in the crosstab dimension. Examples where this is useful is if you are making a report for a single organisation unit with one or more indicators, or if you are making a report with one indicator and one or more organisation units.</p>
          <p>Below, we will go though the steps needed to make a report with a line chart showing the development of three indicators over one year, for one organisation unit. We start by making a report table with the choices shown below:</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="30%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_57.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_60.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>When we open the resulting .jrxml-file in iReport, the default line chart is included. Since we want to make a line chart, we delete this chart and drag a new chart element into the report from the Palette panel.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_61.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_62.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>As soon as we drag the Chart element into the report, a window will appear. We choose the Line chart, as shown below. </p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_63.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>A chart wizard will appear. Click next in the first step, then Finish in the next - we will add the data later.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_64.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_65.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>Next, adjust the size and position of the chart in your report. Then, we will add
            one data series for each of our three indicators. Right-click on the chart and choose
            Chart data. If you are making a chart with one indicator and several organisation units,
            you probably want to make a filter expression so that only data from the
            parameter/parent organisation unit is used in the chart. To do this, add this line to
            the Filter expression area:</p>
          <p><span class="command"><strong>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals("Yes")</strong></span></p>
          <p>In our example, we only have on organisation unit, so this is not necessary. Next, click the details tab to see a list of the series in the chart. For now, this list is empty, but we will add one series for each of our three indicators. To add a series, click the Add button.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_66.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_67.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>In the window that appears, enter the name of the first of the indicators in the Series expression window. Remember to put the name in quotes.  In the category expression (along the x-axis) we want the months, so we use the button next to the field to open the Expression editor and add periodname. </p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_69.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_68.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>In the value expression, we add the actual data values for our first indicator. Use the Expression editor again to do this. When we are finished, the window should look like the one below, only with different names according to the indicator. </p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_70.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>You can then Click OK to close the window. Follow the same steps to add a series for the other indicators. </p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2_creating_reporting/ireportadv/irep_screen_71.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>Close the window, and the data for the line chart should be ready. However, some additional adjustments might be needed - most of these can be found in the Line chart properties panel. For example, when making a month by month chart as we have in example, there is often not enough space for the month names along the category axis. This can be fixed by rotating the labels by for example -40 degrees, by using the property Category Axis Tick Label Rotation.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">

      <p>A standard report might be based on SQL queries. This is useful when you need to access
        multiple tables in the DHIS database and do custom selects and joins. </p>
      <p>- This step is optional, but handy when you need to debug your reports and when you have
        direct access to the database you want to use. Click on the "report datasources" button,
        "New", "Database JDBC connection" and click "next". In this window you can give you
        connection a name and select the JDBC driver. PostgreSQL and MySQL should come included in
        your iReport. Then enter the JDBC connection URL, username and password. The last three
        refers to your database and can be retrieved from your DHIS configuration file
        (hibernate.properties). Click "save". You have now connected iReport to your
        database.</p>
      <p>- Go to standard reports and click "add new", then "get report template". Open this
        template in iReport. This template contains a series of report parameters which can be used
        to create dynamic SQL statements. These parameters will be substituted based on the report
        parameters which we will later select and include in the standard report. The parameters
        are:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>periods - string of comma-separated identifiers of the relative periods</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>period_name - name of the reporting period</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>organisationunits - identifier of the selected organisation units</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>organisationunit_name - name of the reporting organisation unit</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>organisationunit_level - level of the reporting organisation unit</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>organisationunit_level_column - name of the corresponding column in the
            _orgunitstructure resource table</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>These parameters can be included in SQL statements using the $P!{periods} syntax, where
        "periods" represents the parameter.</p>
      <p>- To create a SQL query in iReport, click on the "report query" button. Write or paste
        your query into the textarea. An example SQL query using parameters which will create a
        report displaying raw data values at the fourth level in the org unit hierarchy is:</p>
      <pre class="screen">select district.name as district, chiefdom.name as chiefdom, ou.name as facility,
bcg.value as bcg, yellowfever.value as yellowfever, measles.value as  measles
from organisationunit ou
left outer join _orgunitstructure ous
  on (ou.organisationunitid=ous.organisationunitid)
left outer join organisationunit district
  on (ous.idlevel2=district.organisationunitid)
left outer join organisationunit chiefdom
  on (ous.idlevel3=chiefdom.organisationunitid)
left outer join (
  select sourceid, sum(cast(value as double precision)) as value
  from datavalue
  where dataelementid=359706
  and periodid=$P!{periods}
  group by sourceid) as bcg on bcg.sourceid=ou.organisationunitid
left outer join (
  select sourceid, sum(cast(value as double precision)) as value
  from datavalue
  where dataelementid=35
  and periodid=$P!{periods}
  group by sourceid) as yellowfever on yellowfever.sourceid=ou.organisationunitid
where ous.level=4
and ous.$P!{organisationunit_level_column}=$P!{organisationunits}
order by district.name, chiefdom.name, ou.name;
</pre>
      <p>Notice how all parameters are used in the query, along with SQL joins of resource tables
        in the DHIS database.</p>
      <p>- Finally, back in the add new report screen, we click on "Use JDBC data source". This
        enables you to select any relative period and report parameters for your report. Relative
        periods are relative to today's date. Report parameters will cause a prompt during report
        creation and makes it possible to dynamically select organisation units and periods to use
        for your report during runtime. For the example above, we must select "reporting month"
        under relative periods and both "reporting month" and "organisation unit" under report
        parameters. Click save. This will redirect you to the list of reports, where you can click
        the green "create" icon next to your report to render it.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3576"></a>19.4.4.&nbsp;Designing HTML based standard reports</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>A standard report can be designed using purely HTML and JavaScript. This requires a
        little bit of development experience in the mentioned subjects. The benefit of HTML based
        standard reports is that it allows for maximum flexibility. Using HTML you can design
        exactly the report you want, positioning tables, logos and values on the page according to
        your design needs. You can write and save your standard report design in a regular text
        file. To upload your HTML based standard report to DHIS 2 do the following:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Navigate to standard reports and click "Add new".</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Give the report a name.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select "HTML report" as type.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>If you want to you can download a report template by clicking on "Get HTML report
            template".</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select desired relative periods - these will be available in JavaScript in your
            report.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select report parameters - these will be available in JavaScript in your
            report.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>The report template, which you can download after selecting report type, is a useful
        starting point for developing HTML based standard reports. It gives you the basic structure
        and suggests how you can use JavaScript and CSS in the report. JavaScript and CSS can easily
        be included using standard script and style tags.</p>
      <p>If you selected relative periods when creating the standard report you can access these
        in JavaScript like this:</p>
      <pre class="screen">var periods = dhis2.report.periods; // An array with period identifiers
var period = periods[0];</pre>
      <p>If you selected the organisation unit report parameter when creating the standard report
        you can access the selected organisation unit in JavaScript like this:</p>
      <pre class="screen">var orgUnit = dhis2.report.organisationUnit; // An object
var id = orgUnit.id; 
var name = orgUnit.name;
var code = orgUnit.code;</pre>
      <p>When designing these reports you can utilize the analytics Web API resource in order to
        retrieve aggregated data in JavaScript. Have a look in the Web API chapter in this guide for
        a closer description. As a complete, minimal example you can retrieve analytics data after
        the report has been loaded and use that data to set the inner text of an HTML element like
        this:</p>
      <pre class="screen">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
$( document ).ready( function() {
    $.get( "../api/analytics?dimension=dx:FnYCr2EAzWS;eTDtyyaSA7f&amp;dimension=pe:THIS_YEAR&amp;filter=ou:ImspTQPwCqd", function( json ) {
        $( "#bcg" ).html( json.rows[0][2] );
        $( "#fic" ).html( json.rows[1][2] );
    } );    
} );
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div&gt;BGG coverage: &lt;span id="bcg"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;FIC coverage: &lt;span id="fic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
      <p>A few other tips: To include graphics you can convert an image to SVG and embed that SVG
        content directly in the report - DHIS 2 is based on HTML 5 where SVG tags are valid markup.
        To include charts and maps in your report you can use the charts and maps resources in the
        Web API. You can use the full capability of the Web API from JavaScript in your report - it
        may be useful to read through the Web API chapter to get an overview of all available
        resources.</p>

  <p>DHIS 2 has an optional feature that allows authorized users to approve data that has been entered. It allows data to be reviewed and approved at selected levels in the organisation unit hierarchy, so the approval follows the structure of the hierarchy from lower levels to higher levels.</p>
  <p>Data is approved for a combination of (a) period, (b) organisation unit and (c) workflow.
    Data may be approved for the organisation unit for which it is entered, as well as for
    higher-level organisation units to which the data is aggregated. As part of system settings, you
    can choose the organisation unit level(s) at which data is approved. It can be approved at
    higher levels only after it has been approved for all that organisation unit's descendants
    at lower levels for the same workflow and period. When you approve a workflow, it approves data
    for any data sets that have been assigned to that workflow.</p>
  <p>After a period, organisation unit and workflow combination has been approved, data sets
    associated with that workflow will be locked for that period and organisation unit, and any
    further data entry or modification will be prohibited unless it is first un-approved.</p>
  <p>For example, the following diagram illustrates that data has already been approved for
    organisation units C and D, for a given period and workflow. It may now be approved for
    organisation unit B for the same period and workflow. But it is not ready to be approved for
    organization unit A. Before it can be approved for organisation unit A, it must be approved for
    B, and for any other children of organisation unit A, for that period and workflow.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3611"></a>20.1.&nbsp;Approving and accepting</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>DHIS2 supports two different types of approval processes: either a one-step process where the data is approved at each level, or a two-step process where data is first approved and then accepted at each level. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="d5e3614"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;20.2.&nbsp;Approving and accepting</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="300"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_approval/approval_level_steps.png" align="middle" width="300" alt="Approving and accepting"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div></div><br class="figure-break">
    <p>In the one-step process, data is approved at one level, and then approved at the next higher level. Until it is approved at the next higher level, it may be unapproved at the first level. (For example, if the data was approved my mistake, this allows the  approver to undo their mistake.) Once the data is approved at the next higher level, it may not be unapproved at the lower level unless it is first unapproved at the higher level. </p>
    <p>In the two-step process, data is approved at one level, and then the approval is accepted at the same level. This acceptance is done by a user who is authorized to approve data at the next higher level. Once the data is accepted, it may not be changed or unapproved  unless it is first <span class="italic">unaccepted</span>.</p>
    <p>The two-step process is not required by DHIS2. It is an optional step for a user reviewing data at the next higher level. It has the benefit of locking the acceptance from the level below, so reviewer does not have to worry that the data could be changing from below while it is being reviewed. It can also be used by the higher-level user to keep track of which lower-level data has already been reviewed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3623"></a>20.2.&nbsp;Authorities for approving data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To approve data, you must be assigned a role containing one of these  authorities:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve data</strong></span> - You may approve data for the organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned. Note that this authority does not allow you to approve data for lower-levels below the organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned. This is useful to separate the users authorized to approve at one level from the users authorized to approve at levels below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve data at lower levels</strong></span> - Allows you to approve data for all lower levels below the organisation units assigned to you. This is useful if, for example, you are a district-level user whose role includes approving the data for all the facilities within that district, but not for the district itself. If you are assigned this as well as the <span class="italic">Approve data</span> authority, you may approve data at the level of the organisation unit(s) to which you have been assigned, and for any level below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Accept data at lower levels</strong></span> - Allows you to accept data  for the level just below the organisation unit(s) assigned to you. This authority can be given to the same users as approve data. Or it may be given to different users, if you want to have some users who accept data from the level below, and a different set of users who approve data to go up to the next level above.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3637"></a>20.3.&nbsp;Configuring data approval</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>In the <span class="italic">Settings</span> section under <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span> you can specify the levels at which you want to approve
      data in the system. Click the Add new button on this page and select the organisation unit
      level at which you want approvals. It will be added to the list of approval settings. You may
      configure the system for approving data at every organisation unit level, or only at selected
      organisation unit levels.</p>
    <p>Note that when you add a new approval level, you may optionally choose a Category option
      group set. This feature is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
    <p>Also under <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span>, you can define the
      workflows that will be used for approving data. Each workflow can be associated with one or
      more approval levels. Any two workflows may operate at all the same approval levels as each
      other, some of the same and some different levels, or completely different levels.</p>
    <p>If you want data for a data set to be approved according to a workflow, then assign the
      workflow to the data set when you add or edit the data set. If you do not want data for a data
      set to be subject to approval, then do not assign any workflow to that data set. For data sets
      that you want to approve at the same time as each other, assign them to the same workflow. For
      data sets that you want to approve independently, assign each data set to its own
      workflow.</p>
    <p>On the <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span> page, you may select
      the option <span class="italic">Hide unapproved data in analytics</span> to hide
      unapproved data in reports, pivot table, data visualizer and GIS. If this option is checked,
      unapproved data will be hidden from users assigned to higher-level organisation units compared
      to where approval is required. Users who are assigned to organisation units where data is
      ready for approval can still view the data, as can users assigned to higher-level organisation
      units if they have the <span class="italic">Approve data at lower levels</span>
      authority. If this option is not checked, then all data is shown whether approved or
      not.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3650"></a>20.4.&nbsp;Data visibility</h2></div></div></div>
    
  <p>If the option <span class="italic">Hide unapproved data in analytics</span> is
      enabled, data will be hidden from viewing by users associated with higher levels. When
      determining whether a data record should be hidden for a specific user, the system associates
      a user with a specific approval level and compares it to the level to which the data record
      has been approved up to. A user is associated with the approval level which matches the level
      of the organisation unit(s) she is linked to, or if no approvel level exists at that level,
      the next approval level linked to an organisation unit level below herself. A user will be
      allowed to see data which has been approved up to the level immediately below her associated
      approval level. The rationale behind this is that a user must be ablet to view the data that
      has been approved below so that she can eventually view and approve it herself.</p>
    <p>Note that if the user has been granted the <span class="italic">View unapproved
        data</span> or the <span class="italic">ALL</span> authority she will be able to
      view data irrespective of the approval status.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Lets consider the following example:</span> There are four
      organisation unit levels, with approval levels associated with level 2 and 4. <span class="italic">User A</span> at country level (1) gets associated with approval level 1
      since the approval level exists at the same level as the organisation unit level. <span class="italic">User B</span> gets associated with approval level 2 since there is no
      approval level directly linked to her organisation unit level and approval level 2 is the
      immediate level below. <span class="italic">User C</span> gets associated with approval
      level 2. <span class="italic">User D</span> is below all approval levels which implies
      that she can see all data entered at or below her organisation unit level.</p>

          <p>Data is approved by <span class="italic">User C</span> at district level:

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3679"></a>20.5.&nbsp;Approving data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To approve data, go to <span class="italic">Reports</span> and choose <span class="italic">Data Approval</span>. When this report shows data that is configured for approval, it shows the approval status of the data in the report. The approval status will be one of the following:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Waiting for lower level org units to approve</strong></span> - This
          data is not yet ready to be approved, because it first needs to be approved for all the
          child organisation units to this organisation unit, for the same workflow and
          period.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Ready for approval</strong></span> - This data may now be approved by an authorized user.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approved</strong></span> - This data has already been approved.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approved and accepted</strong></span> - This data has already been approved, and also accepted.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>If the data you are viewing is in an approval state that can be acted upon, and if you have sufficient authority, one or more of the following actions will be available to you on the <span class="italic">Data Approval</span> form:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve</strong></span> - Approve data that has not yet been approved, or that was formerly approved and has been unapproved.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Unapprove</strong></span> - Return to an unapproved state data that has been approved or accepted.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Accept</strong></span> - Accept data that has  been approved.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Unaccept</strong></span> - Return to an unaccepted (but still approved) state data that has been accepted.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>In order to unapprove data for a given organisation unit, you must have the authority to approve data for that organisation unit or to approve data for a higher-level organisation unit to which that data is aggregated. The reason for this is as follows: If you are reviewing data for approval at a higher organisation unit level, you should consider whether the data at lower organisation units are reasonable. If all lower-level data looks good, you can approve the data at the higher level. If some lower-level data looks suspect, you can unapprove the data at the lower level. This allows the data to be reviewed again at the lower level, corrected if necessary, and re-approved up through the organisation unit levels according to the hierarchy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3713"></a>20.6.&nbsp;Approving by category option group set</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>When defining an approval level, you specify the organisation unit level at which data will be approved. You may also optionally specify a category option group set. This is useful if you are using  category option groups to define additional dimensions of your data, and you want approvals to be based on these dimensions. The following examples illustrate how this can be done within a single category option group set, and by using multiple category option group sets.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3716"></a>20.6.1.&nbsp;Approving by one category option group set</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>For example, suppose you define a category option group set to represent NGOs who serve as healthcare partners at one or more organisation units. Each category option group within this set represents a different partner. The category option group for Partner 1 may group together category options (such as funding account codes) that are used by that partner as a dimension of the data. So data entered by Partner 1 is attributed to a category option in Partner 1's category option group. Whereas data entered by partner 2 is attributed to a category option in Partner 2's category option group:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e3719"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;20.1.&nbsp;Example Category Option Groups</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Example Category Option Groups" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Category option group set</th><th>Category option group</th><th>Category options</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Partner 1</td><td>Account 1A, Account 1B</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Partner 2</td><td>Account 2A, Account 2B</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Each partner could enter data for their accounts independently of the other, for the
        same or different workflows, at the same or different facilities. So for example, data can
        be entered and/or aggregated at the following levels for each partner, independently of each
        other:</p>
      <div class="figure"><a name="d5e3737"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;20.4.&nbsp;Example category option groups</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="160"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_approval/approval_partner_example.png" align="middle" width="160" alt="Example category option groups"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div></div><br class="figure-break">
      <div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="resources/images/admon/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>You can use the sharing feature on category options and category option groups to insure that a user can enter data (and/or see data) only for  certain category options and groups. If you don't want users to see data that is aggregated beyond of their assigned category options and/or category option groups, you can  assign <span class="italic">Selected dimension restrictions for data analysis</span>,  when adding or updating a user.</p>
      </td></tr></table></div>
      <p>You can optionally define approval levels for partner data within any or all of these organisation unit levels. For example, you could define any or all of the following approval levels:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e3746"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;20.2.&nbsp;Example Category Option Group Set approval levels</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Example Category Option Group Set approval levels" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Approval level</th><th>Organisation unit level</th><th>Category option group set</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Country</td><td>Partner</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>District</td><td>Partner</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Facility</td><td>Partner</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3767"></a>20.6.2.&nbsp;Approving by multiple category option group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>You can also define approval levels for different category option group sets. To continue the example, suppose that you have various agencies that manage the funding to the different partners. For example, Agency A  funds accounts 1A and 2A, while Agency B  funds accounts 1B and 2B. You could set up category option groups for Agency A, and Agency B, and make them both part of a category option group set called Agency. So you would have:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e3770"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;20.3.&nbsp;Example Multiple Category Option Group Sets</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Example Multiple Category Option Group Sets" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Category option group set</th><th>Category option group</th><th>Category options</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Partner 1</td><td>Account 1A, Account 1B</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Partner 2</td><td>Account 2A, Account 2B</td></tr><tr><td>Agency</td><td>Agency A</td><td>Account 1A, Account 2A</td></tr><tr><td>Agency</td><td>Agency B</td><td>Account 1B, Account 2B</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Now suppose that at the country level, you want each partner to approve the data entered by that partner. Once this approval is done, you want each agency to then approve the data from accounts that are managed by that agency. Finally, you want to approve data at the country level across all agencies. You could do this by defining the following approval levels:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e3796"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;20.4.&nbsp;Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Approval level</th><th>Organisation unit level</th><th>Category option group set</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Country</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Country</td><td>Agency</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Country</td><td>Partner</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Note that multiple approval levels can be defined  for the same organisation unit level. In our example, Partner 1 would approve country-wide data at approval level 3 from category options Account 1A and Account 1B. Next, Agency A would approve country-wide data at approval level 2 from category options Account 1A (after approval by Partner 1) and Account 2A (after approval by Partner 2.) Finally, after approval from all agencies, country-wide data can be approved at approval level 1 across all category options. Note that approval level 1 does not specify a category option group set, meaning that it is for approving data across all category options.</p>
      <p>This example is meant to be illustrative only. You may define as many category option groups as you need, and  as many approval levels as you need at the same organisation unit level for different category option group sets.</p>
      <p>If you have multiple approval levels for different category option group sets at the same organisation unit level, you may change the approval ordering in the <span class="italic">Settings</span> section, under <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span>. Just click on the approval level you wish to move, and select <span class="italic">Move up</span> or <span class="italic">Move down</span>. If you have an approval level with no category option groups set, it must be the highest approval level for that organisation unit level.</p>

  <p>In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the
    same application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals,
    districts, and state). Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and
    hence they work off-line. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be
    synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region.
    For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline,
    say at the health facility level) to another one say at the district level where the data would
    need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a
    HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data
    updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where
    there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to
    fulfill these needs. </p>
  <p>To access the main Import-Export module, choose <span class="guimenu">Services-&gt;Import-Export. </span>A number of services are available, all of which will be described in detail in respective sections below. </p>

      <p>Meta-data objects can be easily imported by accessing Import-Export-&gt;Meta-Data import. Select the file to import  by pressing "Select" and choose the file from your local file system. When importing XML and JSON files, the system will automatically detect which type of objects which should be imported. When importing CSV metadata, you will need to specify the object type. Consult the corresponding section in this manual on "CSV Metadata import" for more specific information on how the CSV file should be created.  </p>

            existing ones. New only will only accept fresh meta-data, usually you would use this on a
            empty database. Updates only will only allow the meta-data to match meta-data that is

        <p>Before doing the import into your database, it is highly recommended that you run the
          import with the dry run option set to true first. This will enabled you to have a look at
          how many new, updates, and ignored meta-data there will be. After you have selected your
          file, set dry run to true, you can now click the import button. After doing this, you will
          be greeted by this window.</p>

        <p>Here you can see that the organisation unit "Nduvuibu MCHP" had a unknown reference to
          an object with ID "aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn", which means that an object with this ID was not
          present in your imported file, and it could not be found in the existing database. Its
          important to note that even if a reference could not be found, the object will still be
          imported, but you might have to fix this directly in DHIS2 later, if the reference should
          have pointed to something else.</p>

        <p>The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, the internal DHIS2 identifier (known as a UID), and also using an  external identifier called called a "code". When the importer is trying to search for
        references (like the one above), it will first go to the UID field, and then to the code
        field. This allows you to import from legacy systems without having a UID for every meta-data
        object. I.e. if you are importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the
        ID field completely (DHIS 2 will fill this in for you) and the put the legacy systems own
        identifiers in the code field, this identifier is required to be unique. This not only works
        for organisation units, but for all kinds of meta-data, allowing for easy import from other
        systems.</p>

      <p>To import CV meta-data go to import-export module and select CSV Meta-Data Import form
        the left side menu. You must select the object type which your CSV file contains. You can
        only upload one type of objects at the time. Upload your file and click update. For the CSV

      <p>The GML import function can be used to import data prepared in the Geography Markup Language (GML). GML can be used to update the coordinates (both polygons and points). Once you have prepared your GML file as detailed in the chapter on "Importing coordinates", you can load the file with this function. </p>
      <p>Importing the organisation unit hierarchy from GML is not supported. Therefore you
        should create the organisation unit hierarchy separately, and then use GML to update the
        coordinates once the hierarchy has been created. </p>

    <p>The import option allows different instance of DHIS 2 to receive standardised sets of data in the absence of a networked system. The functionality can also be used to import data produced by another system (perhaps on a regular basis) or to import legacy data which has been transformed into a format which DHIS2 can understand. Typically, a data set is exported from one DHIS2 instance (e.g. a district level system) to another system (e.g. a provincial level system).  DHIS 2 is also capable of importing data directly from a DHIS 1.4 Access database. Each of these options will be discussed in the following sections. </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="import_another_instance"></a>21.2.1.&nbsp;XML data import</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>To import data in XML format, simply select Services-&gt;Import-export-&gt;XML data
        import. Similar options to the XML meta-data import facility are available. Please refer to
        the Developer guide &gt; Web API &gt; Data values chapter on XML data import for details on the
        XML format which is used by DHIS2 for aggregate data import. </p>

      <p>DHIS2 supports import of data in the CSV (Comma Separated Values)  format. This can be used to import exchange file produced by DHIS2 itself. It also comes in handy when you want to import data from a third-party system as CSV is widely supported in applications and is easy to produce manually.</p>
      <p>To import a CSV data exchange file navigate to the <span class="italic">CSV Data
          Import </span>item in the left-side menu. Upload the exchange file and click <span class="italic">Import</span>. CSV files can be imported both as plain text file or as
        compressed ZIP file archive.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the Developer guide &gt; Web API &gt; Data values chapter on CSV data import
        for a description of the CSV format to use.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="importPDFdata"></a>21.2.4.&nbsp;Importing PDF data</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS2 supports import of data in the PDF format. This can be used to import data produced by off-line PDF data entry forms. Please refer to the section "Data set management" for details on how to produce a PDF form which can be used for off-line data entry. </p>
      <p>To import a PDF data file, navigate to the <span class="italic">PDF Data Import </span>item in the left-side menu. Upload the completed PDF file and click <span class="italic">Import</span>.</p>
      <p>After the import process is finished, you can follow the link to the import summary, which will inform you about the outcome of the import process in terms of number of records imported, updated and ignored and potential conflicts.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhis14import"></a>21.2.5.&nbsp;Importing data from DHIS 1.4</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>There are two ways to import data from a DHIS 1.4 database; 1) through the 1.4 XML-based export files, or 2) directly from the DHIS 1.4 data file (.mdb). Both are accessible from the DHIS 1.4 Import menu under Import in the Import-Export module.</p>
      <p>It is critical that all data integrity violations which are present in the DHIS 1.4
        database be fully resolved before attempting an import into DHIS2. You can check the data
        integrity of DHIS 1.4 through the CORE Module-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Data integrity checks. A
        report will be generated of all data integrity violations which should be resolved prior to
        importing into DHIS2.</p>

        <p>This method is recommend when doing large imports from 1.4, and especially when importing into a new  DHIS2 database.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>DHIS 1.4 File Configuration</strong></span> </p>
        <p>Before you can start the 1.4 file import you need to provide a  few details about the 1.4 database:</p>
        <p><span class="italic">Datafile(#):</span> Here you put the full path to the DHIS 1.4 data file you want to import from, e.g. C:\DHIS14\DHIS_#LR_LIBERIA.mdb. </p>

        <p>Click "Save" and you will return to the DHIS 1.4 File Import window. </p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Import Type:</strong></span></p>
        <p>As with other imports you have the options to Import (directly), Preview, or Analyse the import. We recommend using the Analyse option first to check that the 1.4 database is OK and ready to be imported. </p>
        <p>When importing a large database into a new blank DHIS 2 database we recommend using the Import option to save time. </p>
        <p>For smaller incremental imports the Preview is OK.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Last Updated:</strong></span> </p>
        <p>If you want the full import, all the data in the 1.4 database you leave this field blank.</p>
        <p>If you only want to do an incremental import into an already existing DHIS 2 database you can use this field to filter which data values to import. Only values added or edited after the date you specify will be imported. This filter makes use of the LastUpdated column in the RoutineData table in the DHIS 1.4 data file.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Import process:</strong></span></p>
        <p>When you are done selecting Method, and LastUpdated you can begin the import by
          clicking on the Import button. This process might take a long time, depending on how many
          data values you are importing. On a reasonable spec. computer the import takes about 2
          million records per 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>Although it is possible to import and export data between instances of DHIS 1.4 and
          DHIS 2, there are significant limitations. Currently, the import of some metadata is not
          supported from DHIS 1.4 to DHIS 2. This includes:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Organisational unit alternate names</p>

          </li></ul></div>
        <p>It is also important that the aggregation operator defined in DHIS 1.4 be set to the correct value. Some data, such as population, should have their aggregation operator set to "Average" in DHIS2, as this controls how the aggregation of data is handled over time (but not within the organisational unit hierarchy). </p>

    <p>DHIS2 makes it possible to export various types of data in multiple data formats. You can
      export your data, also referred to as measures or facts; and your meta-data, which refers to
      the information describing your data. Data can be exported both in raw, non-aggregated format
      and in aggregated format. It is also possible to export a combination of data and meta-data in
      case you have special requirements. This chapter covers mainly how to export data and
      meta-data through the user interface of the import-export DHIS 2 module. Data can also be
      exported programmatically through the DHIS 2 Web API, and it is useful to be aware of the
      various options available:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

        <p>Export meta-data programmatically through the Web API: Please refer to the Web API
          chapter, section on meta data.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Data can be exported on various formats, including DXF 2 (the DHIS 2 meta-data and data
      exchange format based on XML), CSV, PDF, MS Excel and the DHIS 1.4 XML format. </p>
    <p>Another aspect of data export is the type of DHIS 2 deployment. In the case of online
      deployment, all data is saved into a single database only. In an offline deployment, each
      instance will store data in a separate database in their local system. In an offline
      deployment, after the data entry is finished, data will have to be manually sent to the next
      level in the organizational hierarchy. In an on-line application this is not required, as all
      data is captured over an Internet connection and stored in a central location.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3974"></a>21.3.1.&nbsp;Metadata export</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Meta-data is "data about data". In the context of DHIS 2, meta-data consists
          of definitions of data elements, indicators, the structure and names contained in the
          organizational hierarchy, and other options. Click on the "Meta-data export" link
          from the main "Data export" screen in order to access this. Just select the
          features, format, and the compression that you want and click "Export". This
          metadata file can then be transmitted just like a data file, except it will contain
          information on the definitions of the various features, as opposed to the values of the
          data themselves. </p>

      </div>
      <p>In this example, we have created a metadata export filter, to export all "Constants" from the system. If any meta-data objects have been selected to be part of the filter, they will be highlighted in green. Click on the name of the objects you would like to export, and add them to the right side to be selected to be part of the export. Once you have composed the filter as needed, click "Save" (when editing) or "Add" (when adding a new metadata filter). </p>
      <p>To export the filter, click on the name from the main "Meta-data detailed export" menu, and choose "Export" from the context menu. The following dialog will appear. </p>

  <p>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataBrowser"></a>22.1.&nbsp;Data browser</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The data browser maintenance and analysis module which allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. The summary view provides a count of data elements which have been entered at the selected organisation unit as well as its descendants. Raw data for all data elements for a range of time periods and a given organisational unit can be browsed and exported to Excel, CSV, or PDF formats. There are four modes of the data browser, which determine how the data is summarized</p>

    <p>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </p>

      <p>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the "orphaned" data element to the appropriate data set. </p>

      <p>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the analytics record sets that provide aggregated data. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4111"></a>22.2.3.&nbsp;Data elements violating exclusive group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
      Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the same data element group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that a data element can <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> be allocated to <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> data element group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Data element groups to review each data element identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4116"></a>22.2.4.&nbsp;Data elements in data set but not in form or sections</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Data elements have been assigned to a data set, but have not been assigned to any sections of the data set forms. All data sets which use section forms, should generally have all data elements in the data set assigned to exactly one section of the dataset. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4119"></a>22.2.5.&nbsp;Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Data elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4122"></a>22.2.6.&nbsp;Data sets not assigned to organisation units</h3></div></div></div>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4125"></a>22.2.7.&nbsp;Sections with invalid category combinations </h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Data sets which use section forms should only have a single category combination within each section. This violation could result from assigning a data element to a section, but then changing the category combination of this data element at a later point in time. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4128"></a>22.2.8.&nbsp;Indicators with identical formulas</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4131"></a>22.2.9.&nbsp;Indicators without groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All data elements and indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. From the main menu, go to Data elements/Indicators -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` indicators to its correct group.</p>

      <p>
      Some indicators have been allocated to several indicator groups that are members of the same indicator group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that an indicator can <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> be allocated to <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> indicator group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Indicator groups to review each indicator identified in the integrity check. Either remove the indicator from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4145"></a>22.2.13.&nbsp;Duplicate periods</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>If periods have been imported from external applications, it may be possible that some periods will be duplicated. If you have any periods which appear to be duplicated here, you will need to resolve these directly in the DHIS2 database. All data which has been assigned to the duplicated period, should be moved to the correct period, and the duplicate period should be removed. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e4148"></a>22.2.14.&nbsp; Organisation units with cyclic references</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Organisation units cannot be both parent and children of each other, directly nor indirectly.

      <p>All organisation units <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be allocated to at least <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any compulsory OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the compulsory rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no compulsory OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one compulsory Group Set (the group set 'Type' are nearly universally relevant).

      <p>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <span class="emphasis"><em>compulsory</em></span> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as compulsory, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the 'Type' group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other 'type' group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.

    <p>It is possible to create custom locales in DHIS2. In addition to the locales available through the system, you might want to add a custom locale such as "English" and "Zambia" to the system. This would allow you to translate metadata objects to local languages, or to account for slight variants between countries which use a common metadata definition. </p>

    <p>The SQL View functionality of DHIS2 will store the SQL view definition internally, and then materialize the view when requested. </p>
    <p>Database administrators must be careful about creating database views directly in the DHIS
      2 database. For instance, when the resource tables are generated, all of them will first be
      dropped and then re-created. If any SQL views depend on these tables, an integrity violation
      exception will be thrown and the process will be aborted.</p>
    <p>The SQL views are dropped in reverse alphabetical order based on their names in DHIS 2,
      and created in regular alphabetical order. This allows you to have dependencies between SQL
      views, given that views only depend on other views which come earlier in the alphabetical
      order. For instance, "ViewB" can safely depend on "ViewA". Otherwise, having views depending
      on other view result in an integrity violation error.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The "Name" attribute of the SQL view will be used to determine the name of the table that DHIS2 will create when the view is materialized by the user. The "Description" attribute allows one to provide some descriptive text about what the SQL view actually does. Finally, the "SQL statement" should contain the SQL view definition. Only SQL  "SELECT" statements are allowed and certain sensitive tables (i.e. user information) are not accessible Press "Save" to store the SQL view definition.</p>

  <p>The settings module provides a set of application configuration options. There are two main
    groups of settings: the <span class="italic">system settings</span> apply to the whole
    system and all its users while the <span class="italic">user settings</span> apply to the
    environment of the currently logged in user. The system settings can be accessed from the
    maintenance menu, settings module. The user settings can be accessed under the profile menu,
    settings page.</p>

            setting the maximum number of analytics records to "unlimited" should be used with

            receive all messages being sent through the function for writing feedback in the

            widget. Under normal circumstances you can leaves this on the lowest level, which is
            default behavior. Setting it to a higher level might be useful in order to reduce
            initial load time in cases where you have a large number of organisation units, typically
            more than 30 000.</p>

          <p>Phone number area code: The area code for the area in which your deployment is
            located. Used for sending and receiving SMS.Typically, this would be a country code, for

            maintenance mode, implying that 503 Service Unavailable will be returned for all
            requests. This is useful when you need to perform maintenance on the server like
            rebuilding indexes while the server is running in production, in order to reduce load
            and more efficiently carry out the maintenance.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Days after period end to qualify for timely data submission: Sets the number of days after the end of a period in which a data entry form must be marked as complete in order to be considered timely. This affects the "reporting rate" tool in the reporting module which lists forms marked as complete as well as marked as complete in time. The default value is 15.</p>

          <p>Omit indicator values with zero numerator value in data mart: Defines whether
            aggregated indicator values with zero as the numerator value should be written to the
            indicator data mart table. Having such values written is required for instance when
            connecting Excel pivot tables to the data mart as Excel will need the numerator data to
            correctly aggregate up in the organisation unit hierarchy. If third-party tools like
            Excel are not used with the application this will reduce the total number of values
            written to the data mart (which again will improve performance) and could safely be set

          <p>Cache strategy: Decides for how long reports and responses related to analysis
            should be cached. If you are using the scheduled, nightly data mart tasks it makes sense
            to put this on "Cache until 6 AM tomorrow". This is because we know that data
            in reports change at that time, and you can safely cache data up to the moment when the
            data mart is updated. If you are loading data continuously into the datamart you should
            set it to "No cache". If you load data very infrequently into data mart you
            should consider setting it to "Cache for two weeks".</p>

          <p>Number of database server CPUs: The number of CPU cores of your database server can
            be configured as a system setting. This allows the system to perform optimally when the

  <p>DHIS 2 provides a range of options to allow data entry from mobile devices, including a dedicated GPRS/3G J2ME client and two versions of DHIS 2 which have been optimized specifically for mobile browsers. Each of these solutions will be described in detail in the following sections. DHIS 2 offers several Android clients, which are described in detail in other sections of this guid.</p>
  <p>Collection of data in the field can be technically challenging and expensive. Mobile phone solutions have the potential to significantly reduce the complexity of deploying a distributed data collection system. Using a simple Java client installed on a mobile phone or a web browser which works on the mobile phone, field workers can report directly to the DHIS 2 database through their mobile device.</p>
  <p>While mobile phone solutions have a great potential, there are complexities with such deployments. Phones lack processing power and have a small display, they need to be charged, and often such deployments make the most sense in areas with poor or intermittent network coverage.</p>
  <p>Each of the mobile solutions are introduced briefly below, and the discussed in separate sections in detail:</p>

      <p>DHIS 2 Light: A mobile browser optimized data entry module for all devices</p>
      <p>This module allows for data entry directly with the browser of the mobile device. A wide range of devices and mobile browsers are supported including: Opera mini 3 &amp; 4 (basic and advanced) - Opera mini 4, Nokia S40 mobiles ,Windows Phone 7, Window Mobile 6, Palm Pre, Blackberry (v5 and v6), Firefox mobile, iOS devices (iPhone) and Android devices. This client does not have offline-support, and an active GPRS/3G connection is required.
 It does not require a new application installation on the phone to support new features, but does require a stable data connection for use. This solution is described in <a class="xref" href="#mobile_web_based" title="24.2.&nbsp;Mobile browser based data entry">Section&nbsp;24.2, &#8220;Mobile browser based data entry&#8221;</a></p>

      <p>DHIS 2 Smartphone client: A mobile browser optimized data entry module for Smartphone devices</p>
      <p>This module allows for data entry directly with the browser of a Smartphone. Offline data entry is supported and it does not require any installation of a special client on the phone itself.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>J2ME GPRS/3G client</p>
      <p>DHIS-mobile includes two separate J2ME clients supporting GPRS/EDGE/3G as a transport mechanism. One clients supports facility aggregate reporting and the second client supports name-based program tracking. These clients are split into separate applications to make deployment easier. Some health workers may have both applications installed on their phone. Both of these clients support offline-storage of data and work on J2ME enabled devices (feature phones). This solution is described in <a class="xref" href="#mobile_j2me_gprs_3g" title="24.3.&nbsp;J2ME GPRS/3G Client">Section&nbsp;24.3, &#8220;J2ME GPRS/3G Client&#8221;</a>.</p>
      <p>An active GPRS/3G connection is required in order to send data to the DHIS 2 database, but data can be entered offline and transmitted when a connection is present. This client is intended primarily for low-end devices which support J2ME applications, although the offline-supports adds some memory requirements which limits the handset selection. While the solution is primarily tested on Nokia phones, it also works on several other J2ME capable handsets.</p>
      <p>The facility reporting J2ME client is described in <a class="xref" href="#mobile_j2me_gprs_3g_facility_reporting" title="24.3.2.&nbsp;J2ME GPRS 3G facility reporting client">Section&nbsp;24.3.2, &#8220;J2ME GPRS 3G facility reporting client&#8221;</a></p>

    <p>This approach is for data-entry on a smart phone with a mobile browser by navigating to
      the URL of the DHIS2 instance, for example: the full URL link for demo on <a class="ulink" href="dhis2.org" target="_top">dhis2.org</a>
      <a class="ulink" href="http://apps.dhis2.org/dev/mobile/index.action" target="_top">http://apps.dhis2.org/dev/mobile/index.action</a> . And your mobile browser will
      automatically detect the DHIS2 application where the server URL is given (e.g.: <a class="ulink" href="http://apps.dhis2.org/dev" target="_top">http://apps.dhis2.org/dev</a>). Here is the login form
      to access the application with user-name and password. Click on "Login" to continue
      or "Reset" to reset:</p>

  <p>The DHIS2 GPRS/3G mobile module provides a mechanism for remote clients using mobile phones to enter data directly into the DHIS2 system. There are two functions of the client, namely:</p>
  <p>The solution relies on the mobile phone having a data connection available (i.e.
    GPRS, Edge, 3G), over which it communicates with a DHIS2 instance which must be publicly
    available on the internet, as any other web server. The client application on the phone downloads the data entry forms to the phone from the
    server, and the forms can therefore be updated without installing a new application. This is also a crucial feature 
    for community reporting, which relies on regularly downloading activity plans from the server.

    <p>Data connection availability can be a problem in many of the contexts where DHIS2 mobile
      reporting would otherwise be a good solution for getting data directly into DHIS2. If that is
      the case for you, you might want to consider trying the SMS based solution described in a
      separate document. Keep in mind that even though a data connection is currently required for
      communication between the server and the mobile phone, it is only required when initializing
      or updating the mobile application and when sending reports to the server. The phone stores
      all entered data locally, so it can work fine with only temporary access to a data connection
      on a regular basis. </p>

        divided into sections, each section is displayed as a separate page on the phone. If a data

      <p>By default, data elements will be sorted according to the global sorting assigned in DHIS2. If sections are used, their section specific sorting order  will be used.
      In some cases, when sections are not used, a data element might be used in multiple data sets, and conflict in the way it should be sorted in individual data sets. A work around for this situation is to wrap the whole dataset in one section (note that this will only work if the data elements have the same category option combo)</p>

      <p>To make it possible to compare and update the data sets on the mobile phone with the

        <p>Initialization should be performed before the phones are delivered end-users.  Given the large variation in possible phone configurations, it is impossible to describe the exact steps which are required in order to enable the client on the phone. However, for most phones, simply copying the DHIS Web Mobile client "JAR" file to the phone with a USB cable or via Bluetooth is sufficient. Of course, GPRS/3G connectivity must be enabled. Contact your mobile service provider for exact details on the configuration of the phones and networks. </p>

    <p>The SMS command is basically defined by its parser type. In other word, each SMS command has one unique parser to parse the plain text SMS, then the result will be used for the purpose of that SMS command.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e5351"></a>24.4.2.1.&nbsp;SMS Command for Reporting Data</h4></div></div></div>
      
      <p>In order to report data for example data set (aggregation), we use SMS commands which have KEY_VALUE_PARSER (for phone's plain text), or J2ME_PARSER (for j2me apps)</p>
      <p>

      <p>If the command has name "report", and a list of data element with code like above. The format should be: [command's name] [code][value] [code][value] [code][value]....,the [value] of course might be changed depends on real data, so you have to preapre a SMS text like this example: <span class="bold"><strong>report vo2 vn5 a2 b6 z3 x1</strong></span></p>
      <p>In case the command has a separator for instance ".", the SMS text should be:</p>
      <p>                <span class="bold"><strong>report vo.2.vn.5.a.2.b.6.z.3.x.1</strong></span></p>

  <p>SMS Service is a generic service used for sending/receiving SMS. Any other Dhis2 module can include this service and utilize it to send and receive SMS from users or workers in the field.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e5389"></a>24.5.1.&nbsp;Setting up SMS service</h3></div></div></div>
    
    <p>There are few pre-requisites in order to make this service functional. There are two ways to complete these steps. One way is to configure gateway from the GUI in Mobile Configuration Module. The other
    way is to use SMS Web Api.</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

      <p>There are five different types of Gateways supported by SMS Service. SMS can be sent if any one of the gateway is configured. If more than one gateways are present, then they will be used in round-robin fashion for load balancing.
      There are different parameters for different type of gateway. The Gateway can be configured in GUI in Mobile Configuration Module as shown in the figure. More information about parameters needed to configure 
      gateway can be found in <a class="link" href="#gateway.configuration" title="24.5.2.&nbsp;Gateway Configurations">Gateway Configuraitons</a></p>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="d5e5499"></a>Chapter&nbsp;25.&nbsp;Using Event Capture</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d5e5501">25.1.

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e5501"></a>25.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The event capture app allows users to register events that occurred at a particular time
      and place. An event can happen at any given point in time. This stands in contrast to routine
      data, which can be captured for predefined, regular intervals. Events in DHIS 2 are linked to
      a program. Hence, the event capture app lets you select the organisation unit and program and
      specifiy a date when a event (also known as case or record) happened, before entering
      information for the event.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e5504"></a>25.2.&nbsp;Capturing events</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To capture an event, the first step is to select an organisation unit from the left-side
      organisation unit tree. After selecting an org unit, the list of programs will display the
      programs which have been associated with the selected organisation unit and which have been
      given access to the current user through user roles. Events are displayed in a tabular fashion
      as shown in the figure below. As seen in the screenshot, each row corresponds to an event. The
      columns display information about the events, more specifically they display data for data
      elements which are part of the program.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/event_capture/event_list.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>All event related operations are accessible from the screen shown above. The operations
      currently available are: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Capturing data:</strong></span> this available by clicking the
            "Register event" button.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Showing/hiding colums: </strong></span>this is to allow users
            decide which columns to show/hide in the table of events. This feature is especially
            important when we have a long list of data elements assigned to a program stage.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Editing:</strong></span> the rows in the table are clickable,
            clicking them shows three menus - <span class="bold"><strong>Edit</strong></span>, <span class="bold"><strong>Edit in grid</strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong>Remove.</strong></span> The
            edit function takes you to a new page where information for the selected event can be
            updated. The edit in grid function allows you to edit the selected event within the
            table but only those columns (data elements) visible in the grid. If more columns are
            required it is possible to add using the "Show/Hide columns" button to speficy which
            columns should be displayed in the list.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Sorting:</strong></span> this can be done by clicking the sorting
            icon of each column header. A red sorting icon implies the current sorting column.
            However, the sorting functionality works only within the page displayed. Currently, it
            is not possible to do sorting from serverside.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Filtering:</strong></span> this is done by clicking the small
            search icon shown to the right of each column header. Clicking them provides an input
            field to type a filtering criteria. The system starts applying the filter the moment a
            user starts to type. During filtering it is possible to define start and end dates for
            date type data elements and lower and upper limits for number types. Server side
            filtering is not-support at the moment.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Paging:</strong></span> The list of events can be paged by using
            the paging section at the bootom of the list. Paging allows you to quickly move between
            pages of events and to change the page size, i.e. the number of events per page.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Printing:</strong></span> The "Print list" button allows to print
            the list of events. This button also changes its label accordingly - for example "Print
            details" and "Print form" - and does the printing functionality.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
    <p>The event capture app works offline, in the sense that if Internet connectivity drops
      during your working session, you can continue to capture events which will be stored locally
      in your web browser (client). When connectivity has returned the system will ask to upload
      locally stored data, and sends it to the server where it is stored. Note that if the Web
      browser is closed while in offline-mode, it is not possible to reopen a new browser window and
      continue the working session; however the data will still be saved locally and can be uploaded
      to the server the next time the machine is online and the user has logged into the
      server.</p>
    <p>If the selected program's program stage is configured to capture GPS coordinate, the app
      provides two ways of capturing coordinates. The first is two simple text boxes so that a user
      can fillin proper latitude and longitude values. The second option is using google map, where
      it is possible to point and click for coordinates. The google map option also displays
      polygons and points that are defined for organisation units.</p>
    <p>Another feature availble in the Event capture app is skip-logic and validation
      functionality. Using program rules engine it is possible to put some rules for a program and
      take some actions when the rules are met. Currently supported actions are skipping/hiding a
      dataelement or an entire section, display warning for some soft-validations or display error
      for hard-validations. For example if a rule defined says "DataElementA &gt; 100" and has action
      as "show warning" and message "Datalelement A can not have value more than 100". What will
      happen during data entry is - the moment a value greater than 100 is entered for data element
      A, the warning message will be dsiplayed. Because, it is just a warning it is still possible
      to keep the value more than 100. However, if the action is "Show error", the error message
      will be displayed and the system will also ignore the value - i.e. it is not possible to store
      a value that viloates the rule.</p>
    <p>Together with the rules engine expression evaluation, on-the-fly indicator expression
      evaluation is also supported.  If a program has indicators defined for it and the moment all
      values related to the indicator expression are filled, the system will calcualte indicator and
      display the result. A figure below demonstrates this.</p>

    <p>The event reports app enables analysis of events in two fashions.</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Pivot table-style analysis with aggregated values of events</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e5557"></a>26.1.1.&nbsp;Pivot tables with aggregated values</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>By selecting "Aggregated values" from the top-left menu you can use the event reports
        app to create pivot tables with aggregated numbers of events. An event report is always
        based on a program. You can do analysis based on a range of dimensions. Each dimension can
        have a corresponding filter. Dimensions can be selected from the left-side menu and includes
        the following:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data elements</strong></span>: Start by selecting the program and
            program stage for the event report. The data elements associated with the selected
            program will be listed under available items. Each data element acts as a dimension, and
            can be selected by double-clicking on it. After selecting a data element, it will be
            visible under "selected data items". Here you can specify a filter for each data
            element, with operators such as "greater than", "in" or "equal" together with a filter
            value.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Periods</strong></span>: For the period dimension you have three
            options: relative periods, fixed periods and start/end dates. Relative periods can e.g.
            be "last 12 months", and has the advantage that it keeps the data in the report up to
            date as time goes. Fixed periods can e.g. be "January 2014". You can swith to start/end
            dates by selecting from the drop-down menu under the periods tab, which lets you specify
            flexible dates for the time span in the report.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Organisation units</strong></span>: The organisation unit dimension
            lets you select any org unit from the hierarchy. You can use the org unit mode selector
            to select org units explicitly, by org unit hierarchy levels and by org unit
            groups.</p>
        </li></ul></div>

      </div>
      <p>By clicking <span class="bold"><strong>Layout</strong></span> from the top menu you can control
        which dimensions should appear as columns, rows and filters in the pivot table. Note that
        each data element appears as individual dimensions and can be placed on any of the
        axes.</p>
      <p>Note that data elements of continuous value types (real numbers/decimal numbers) can only
        be used as filters, and will automatically be positioned as filters in the layout dialog.
        The reason for this is that continuous number cannot be grouped into sensible ranges and
        used on columns and rows.</p>
      <p>Event reports can be saved as favorites by clicking on "Favorites" in the top menu.
        Favorites can later be restored by clicking on them in the list of favorites.</p>
      <p>Event reports can be downloaded in various popular formats by clicking on the "Download"
        button on the top menu.</p>

      <p>By selecting "Individual cases" from the top-left menu you can use the event reports
        app to make searches or queries for events based on a flexible set of criteria. The report
        will be displayed as a table with one row per event. Each dimension can be used as a column
        in the table or as a filter. Each dimension can have a criteria (filter). Data elements of
        type option set allows for "in" criteria, where multiple options can be selected. Numeric
        values can be compared to filter values using greater than, equal or less than

    <p>The event visualizer app enables chart analysis of events.</p>

      <p>An event report is always based on a program. You can do analysis based on a range of
        dimensions. Each dimension can have a corresponding filter. Dimensions can be selected from
        the left-side menu and includes the following:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data elements</strong></span>: Start by selecting the program and
            program stage for the event report. The data elements associated with the selected
            program will be listed under available items. Each data element acts as a dimension, and
            can be selected by double-clicking on it. After selecting a data element, it will be
            visible under "selected data items". Here you can specify a filter for each data
            element, with operators such as "greater than", "in" or "equal" together with a filter
            value.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Periods</strong></span>: For the period dimension you have three
            options: relative periods, fixed periods and start/end dates. Relative periods can e.g.
            be "last 12 months", and has the advantage that it keeps the data in the report up to
            date as time goes. Fixed periods can e.g. be "January 2014". You can swith to start/end
            dates by selecting from the drop-down menu under the periods tab, which lets you specify
            flexible dates for the time span in the report.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Organisation units</strong></span>: The organisation unit dimension
            lets you select any org unit from the hierarchy. You can use the org unit mode selector
            to select org units explicitly, by org unit hierarchy levels and by org unit
            groups.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/images/event_visualizer/event_visualizer.png"></div>
      </div>
      <p>By clicking <span class="bold"><strong>Layout</strong></span> from the top menu you can control
        which dimensions should appear as columns, rows and filters in the pivot table. Each data element
        appears as individual dimensions and can be placed on any of the axes. Note that the series and
        category panels can only have one dimension at the time.</p>
      <p>Note that data elements of continuous value types (real numbers/decimal numbers) can only
        be used as filters, and will automatically be positioned as filters in the layout dialog.
        The reason for this is that continuous number cannot be grouped into sensible ranges and
        used on columns and rows.</p>
      <p>Event charts can be saved as favorites by clicking on "Favorites" in the top menu.
        Favorites can later be restored by clicking on them in the list of favorites.</p>
      <p>Event charts can be downloaded in various popular formats by clicking on the "Download"
        button on the top menu.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e5663"></a>28.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Tracker capture is an advanced version of the event capture app. While the event capture
      deals with single event without registration, tracker capture deals with multiple events
      (including single event) with registration. The implication of this is that, any event
      capturing has to be for a registered tracked entity instance (TEI). This makes
      registration/searching of TEI a key component of the tracker capture app. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e5666"></a>28.2.&nbsp;TEI Searching/Registration</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To proceed with the tracker capture one needs to have a TEI. As shown in the screenshot
      below, the first page of the app provides two features for this - searching an existing one or
      registering a new one.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/search_register.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>All searching and registration operations are accessible from the screen shown above.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Searching: there are two modes of searching - simple and advanced. The simple one
            works by typing a free text on the provided area. What is typed in the input box is
            applied across all attributes for partial match. The advanced one, which is accessible
            when the small drop-down button is clicked - works when various search criteria are
            provided in the drop down window. Here, the match is exact match. Both search modes
            return matching list of TEI displayed in a table. </p>
          <p>If a program is selected, the app provides further filtering on the table based on
            enrollment status which are All, Active, Completed, Cancelled.  as shown below.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="20%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/enrollment_status.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>The advanced search also provides one more additional feature. Under normal
            circumstances, advanced search is conducted for the selected orgunit (from left-hand
            side tree) and scope (which could be Selected, Immediate children or All children).  The
            left-hand side tree is generated based on the logged in user's assigned orgunits.
            However, there could be cases to search for a TEI from another orgunit (which is not
            neccessarily part of the assigned orgunits. To support such use case, advanced search
            provides another orgunit tree. The tree displayed here depends on the role that the
            logged in user has. If the user has role "Search Tracked Entity Instance in All Org
            Units" or "ALL", a tree with all available orgunits is provided other wise the tree
            displayed in advanced search is the same as the one on the left-hand side. Whichever
            tree (or hierarchy of orgunits) is provided, if an orgunit is selected in advanced
            search, the searching is conducted against this selected orgunit and scope.</p>
          
          <p>While in the TEI table, clicking on any row takes to the selected TEI's
            dashboard.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Registration: this is accessible through the "Register" button. During registration,
            it is possible to stay on the same page and keep doing more registration or go straight
            to the dashboard of the registered TEI. Selecting a program and doing registration also
            performs enrollment at the background. If a TEI is registered without a program, then
            enrollment is possible from the TEI dashboard. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during registration.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Both search and registration are dictated by a selected program. It is program attributes
      which are being used as search criteria, registration attributes and also as columns names for
      tracked entity list. If no program is selected, the system picks default attributes. If no
      search criteria is assigned for an attribute, then the attribute has no effect on searching.
      However to control the appearance or not of an attribute as a column list, one has to go
      through a menu available under the small gear icon. </p>
    <p>Once a TEI is obtained - either through searching or registration - the app presents the
      selected TEI's dashboard.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e5692"></a>28.3.&nbsp;TEI dashboard</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>All operations on a tracked entity are available from this dashboard. Anticipating
      multiple usecases or operations on registered TEI, we have structured the dashboard as a
      collection of widgets - more widgets can be added. This helps to scale and handle complexity
      while staying simple and clean. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/tei_dashboard.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>As shown in the figure above, the dashboard starts with four sets of menus at the top: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>back button - this helps to go back to the search and registration page</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>previous and next buttons - these are buttons to acces the previous/next TEI
            details</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>program selection menu - this is to dictate what kind of data to record and track
            for the selected TEI. This also affects the contents of the widgets.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>a small pin icon at the right corner - this allows to pin (or stick) the right side of
            the widgets. This is useful especially during data entry. If for example there are a
            many data elements or big form to fill, sticking the right side helps to remain visible
            while scrolling data entry part.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>a small gear icon at the right corner - currently three functionalities are
            available from this icon. 
            </p><div class="screenshot">
              
              <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="20%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/settings_icon.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
            </div><p>            
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                <p> Show/hide widgets - this helps to control which widgets to display. From the
                  figure above, there are eight widgets on display. The widgets are collapsible,
                  responsive and draggable - this helps to acquire optimal view area as per user
                  needs. Widget (re)arrangments are saved automatically per user per program.
                </p>
              </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Save dashboard layout as default - widgets arrangement is saved automatically
                  everytime a widget's position or state (expand/collapse) is changed. However, for
                  the entrie layout to be considered a default layout for the selected program it is
                  required to explicitly save as "Default layout". </p>
              </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Set tei to active/inactive - this has nothing to do with widgets or the
                  dashboard but it helps to set the status of dashborad owner (the TEI) to either
                  active or inactive. If a TEI is set to inactive, only read operations are allowed
                  - no data entry, no profile editing, no enrollment.</p>
              </li></ol></div>
        </li></ul></div>
    <p> The widgets:- </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Enrollment</strong></span> - this helps to enroll the TEI for the
            selected program. If an active enrollment already exists, the widget automatically
            displays it with some details about it. The widget also helps to do some operations on
            the selected enrollment - for example terminate/complete or a possibility to mark the
            enrollment for followup. The later one helps for example to deal with high-risk cases
            during pregnancy followup. A link to history is also provided if the TEI has historical
            enrollment.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Indicators</strong></span> - any indicator defined for the selected
            program will have its value cacluated and displayed under this widget. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataentry</strong></span> - this is for doing data entry using
            either default or custom forms. Depending on program definition, in particular program
            stages, events will be displayed in a timely fashion. Clicking on any of them displays
            the corresponding data entry. If a stage needs new event, a plus icon is displayed for
            new event creation. To proceed with data entry, it is mandatory to have event date. Once
            an event date is specified it is not possible to change due date. The assumption is that
            by specifying event date, the event has already taken place. If the event hasn't
            occurred yet, it is possible to change due date - this is effectively doing nothing but
            rescheduling. The buttons at the bottom help to change the status of a selected event.
            Another key feature from this widget is addition of multiple notes for an event.
            Normally data recording is through datalements, however there are cases where it is
            necessary to record additional information or comments. This is where the notes section
            comes handy. However, a interesting feature here is - it is not possible to delete a
            note. The idea is notes are more like log books. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during data entry.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notes</strong></span> - this is the same as event notes. The
            difference between the two is that, here notes are attached not to events but to
            enrollments. This helps to record some notes based on enrollment - for example why is an
            enrollment terminated or what is the overall observation of the TEI throughout the
            enrollment.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Report</strong></span> - this is to provide a "journal" of the TEI
            per program. A report row is provided for each program the TEI is/was associated.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Profile </strong></span> - this is to edit TEI's profile or
            attributes. Here, if the TEI has an attribute of value type "Tracker Associate", a small
            icon next to the input filed is displayed. Clcking the icon opens a popup where users
            are allowed to either search or register new associate.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Active programs</strong></span> - this is an extension of the
            enrollment widget. While the enrollment widget displays both active and historical
            enrollment for the selected program, active programs widget displayes all other programs
            that the selected TEI has active enrollments.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Relationship </strong></span> - this helps to relate the selected
            TEI (the one whose dashboard is shown) to another TEI. Adding a relative is possible by
            either searching from existing or registering a new one. If a program is selected while
            registering a new one, the new one will be automatically enrolled to the selected
            program. Another interesting feature in the relationship widget is attribute
            inheritance. For example take Mother-Child relationship and assume there are two
            programs Antenatal care for the mother and Immunization for the child. If among others
            first name, last name and address attributes are required for both programs, it is
            possible to configure last name and address attributes as inheritable. Then during child
            registration, there is no need to refill these inheritable attributes - they can be
            automatically populated based on the mother's value. If for some reason a different
            value is required for the child, it is possible to override.</p>

    <p>Tracker capture app also provides some basic reports. These reports are accessible by
      clicking on the "Reports" link on the left-hand side. Below is a description for some of the
      reports.</p>

    <p>Running any of these repots is very easy, one just has to select a program, orgnisation
      unit scope and whenever possible start and end dates. Below is a sample program summary
      report. It displays a list of TEI's and their records for "MNCH/PNC (Adult Woman)" program.
      The records are organized in the form of tabs where each tab is a program stage. The columns
      in the table are data elements which are configured to be displayed in reports under program
      stage definition.</p>

      <p>Conventionally, public health systems have been recording and reporting aggregate data
        of the services provided across various health programmes. This is crucial in monitoring
          "<span class="italic">reach</span>" and "<span class="italic">availability</span>" of public health services, but it lacks the ability of
        tracing the persons being provided with these services and quality of these ones. </p>
      <p>For example, the aggregate report will show  300 pregnant women registered  for ANC and 120 women given IFA tablets or 90 women given TT injection. In an aggregate system, it is not possible to ascertain that if a particular pregnant woman registered for ANC, has also been given IFA and TT, as data only shows aggregate numbers. To understand the quality of services given to each pregnant woman registered for ANC, immunization cycle of each child or treatment of each leprosy person, etc. it is important that treatment information of each person is maintained as an individual case.</p>
      <p>The DHIS tracker module ( also known as  DHIS Community Module  ) is an integrated module in DHIS2, built to support community health systems and facilitate a smooth integration between the community health data and aggregated data management.</p>
      <p>The module supports definition of  types of entities which can be tracked through the system, which can be anything from persons to commodities, e.g medicine, person,.. For the types of entities defined, users can manage community health programs, such as child immunization, maternal health and e.g. allows tracking of individuals enrolled in various programs and activity planning for community health workers</p>

      <p>The module supports health providers for registering treatment cases and tracks these cases over time through different forms that are filled for the treatment of each person.</p>
      <p>The process  starts with the entity registration. When an entity who is registered in the system, the application will guide the health provider  the services required for this entity through activity plan and the services  from time to time can be updated into the entity's profile. </p>
      <p>Below is an example about the working process of Mother and child health programme described in steps depicted in picture below - </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/patients_programs/name_based_information_tracking_process.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>The process of  creating a new entity in the system is through the registration process. The entity is first registered in the system (or checked if the entity already exists in system). Searching a entity can be done through attributes defined (name, address,  e.g.). If the entity already exists in the system, the program enrollment process can continue. If the entity is not available,  new registration takes place. </p>
      <p>For identification a entity, the health worker is first identified through any of the unique attributes or/and some attributes ( such as name, address, phone number, e.g. )  in the system. After identification, treatment cases can be updated for  the visits that they have received.</p>
      <p>After enrolled into a health programme, the entity is provided with various services through the treatment which
          are being recorded. Based on the services of the program by the time, the system creates
          an activity plan for the entity.</p>
      <p>Each interaction with the entity related to the case is considered to be an treatment case and these cases are recorded into the individual case. Individual case is updated with the identification of both the health worker and the entity that is receiving the service.</p>
      <p>Finally, the individual cases and  information of entities can used for health reports.</p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>In some cases, health staff just need to save  health treatment cases for reaching / aggregating  data without private information of entities. The registration progress will be skipped. The progress of these case will be start from step 3. For instance of a programs without registration (e.g. In-Patient Morbidity and Mortality program, Death Certificate), users only need to input treatment case and then export reports.</p>

  <p>This chapter covers how to configure and use program indicators. Program indicators are expressions based on data elements and attributes of tracked entities, which can be used to calculate values based on a formula.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e7154"></a>30.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The purpose of program indicators is to provide a way to produce calculated values based
      on data elements and attributes. Program indicators have an aggregation type, an expression
      and a filter, which in combination determines how the indicator will be evaluated.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e7157"></a>30.2.&nbsp;Setup</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Program indicators can be managed from the "Programs and Attributes" app. Once in the app,
      navigate to Programs. A program indicator belongs to exactly one program, so click on the
      program for which you want to create an indicator and from the context menu navigate to "View
      program indicators". This will open the list of existing indicators, if any, for this
      program.</p>
    <p>To <span class="bold"><strong>add</strong></span> an indicator, click the "Add new" button in the
      top right corner. This will open the new indicator screen. Provide a name, short name, code,
      description, value type, expression and filter for the indicator.</p>
    <p>To <span class="bold"><strong>edit</strong></span> an indicator, click on the relevant indicator in
      the list to open the context menu and click "Edit". This will open the edit indicator screen,
      where you can modify the relevant values.</p>
    <p>To <span class="bold"><strong>remove</strong></span> an  indicator, click on the relevant indicator
      in the list to open the context menu and click "Remove". Click "OK" in the confirmation dialog
      to remove the indicator.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e7171"></a>30.3.&nbsp;Indicator evaluation</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Program indicators are evaluated based on the assigned aggregation type, expression and filter. The
      order of evaluation is as follows:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>The <span class="italic">filter</span> will filter the events which become part
          of the evaluation / aggregation routine.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The <span class="italic">expression</span> will be evaluated per event.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>All evaluated expression values will be <span class="italic">aggregated</span>
          according to the aggregation type of the program indicator.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e7184"></a>30.3.1.&nbsp;Aggregation type</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The aggregation type determines how the program indicator
        will be aggregated. The following aggregation types are available:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Average</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Sum</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Count</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Standard Deviation</p>

          <p>Variance</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Min</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Max</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Custom</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e7204"></a>30.3.1.1.&nbsp;Custom aggregation type</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The "custom" aggregation type is special, as it allows you to specify the aggregation
          type in-line in the expression. All other aggregation types are applied to the entire
          expression.</p>
        <p>Using the "custom" aggregation type might lead to an exception of the order of
          evaluation described above where individual parts of the expression can be evaluated and
          aggregated, as opposed to the entire expressio being evaluated prior to aggregation.</p>
        <p>The following aggregation type operators can be used within expressions: sum, count,
          stddev, variance, min, max.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e7209"></a>30.3.2.&nbsp;Expression</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The expression defines how the indicator is being calculated. The expression can contain
        references to various entities which will be substituted with a related values when the
        indicator is calculated:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Data elements: Will be substituted with the value of the data element for the time
              period and organisation unit for which the calculation is done. Refers to both program
              stage and data element.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Attributes: Will be substituted with the value of the attribute for the person /
              tracked entity for which the calculation is done.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Variables: Will be substituted with special values linked to the program,
              including incident date and date of enrollment for the person, current date and count
              of values in the expression for the time period and organisation unit for which the
              calculation is done.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Constants: Will be substituted with the value of the constant.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
      <p>The expression is a mathematical expression that can contain operators which include
      multiply, divide, plus and minus. The expression will be evaluated <span class="italic">per event</span>, then aggregated according to its aggregation type.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/program_indicator/program-indicator-expression.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>An example expression that includes both attributes, data elements and constants looks like
      this:</p><pre class="screen">(A{GPkGfbmArby} + #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) * C{bCqvfPR02Im}</pre>
      <p>An example expression which uses the custom aggregation type and hence can use inline
      aggregation types looks like
      this:</p><pre class="screen">(sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.K0A4BauXJDl} * #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) / sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH})) * 100</pre>
      <p>Notice how the "sum" aggregation operator is used inside the expression itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e7233"></a>30.3.3.&nbsp;Filter</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The filter is applied to events and filters the data
      source used for the calculation of the indicator. I.e. the filter is applied to the set of
      events before the indicator expression is being evaluated. The filter must evaluate to either
      true or false. It filter is applied to each individual event. If the filter evaluates to true
      then the event is included later in the expression evaluation, if not it is ignored. The
      filter can, in a similar way as expressions, contain references to data elements, attributes
      and constants.</p>
      <p>The indicator filter can in addition use logical operators including the
        following:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e7237"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;30.1.&nbsp;Operators</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Operators" border="1"><colgroup><col class="c1"><col class="c2"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>and</td><td>Logical AND</td></tr><tr><td>or</td><td>Logical OR</td></tr><tr><td>==</td><td>Equal to</td></tr><tr><td>!=</td><td>Not equal to</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;</td><td>Less than</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;=</td><td>Less than or equal to</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;</td><td>Greater than</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;=</td><td>Greater than or equal to</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately evaluate to either
        true or false. For example. one can assert that multiple data elements must be a specific value, or
        that specific attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/program_indicator/program-indicator-filter.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>You can switch between data elements, attributes, variables and constants by using the
      tabs. You can include such items into expressions and filters by double-clicking in the list.
      The buttons below the expression area can be used to insert operators.</p>
      <p>An example filter that uses both attributes and data elements looks like
      this:</p><pre class="screen">A{cejWyOfXge6} == 'Female' and #{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} &lt;= 2</pre>
      <div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="resources/images/admon/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>DHIS 2 is using the JEXL library
      for evaluating expressions which supports additional syntax beyond what is covered in this
      documentation. See the reference at the <a class="ulink" href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html" target="_top">project home page</a> to learn how you can create more sophisticated expressions</p>

      <p>The indicator expression and filter support a range of functions. The functions can be
        applied to data elements and attributes:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e7286"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;30.2.&nbsp;Functions</b></p><div class="table-contents">

  <p>This chapter covers how to configure and use program rules. Program rules provide a means to control
        dynamic behavior of the user interface in tracker and event capture. Program rules are based on expressions composed of  data elements and 
        attributes of tracked entities.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e7376"></a>31.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The purpose of program rules is to provide a way to produce complex dynamic behaviors in 
            tracker and event capture. The program rules enables the programs to respond to data values
            entered in a program. The behaviors that can be configured as of now is skip logic and validation
            rules. Program rules is consisting of one <span class="bold"><strong>expression</strong></span>, and one 
            or more <span class="bold"><strong>actions</strong></span> that is triggered in the user interface when 
            the <span class="bold"><strong>expression</strong></span> is true.
        </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e7382"></a>31.2.&nbsp;Setup</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>          Program rules can be managed from the "Programs and Attributes" app. Once in the app,
            navigate to Programs. A program rule belongs to exactly one program, so click on the
            program for which you want to manage rules and from the context menu navigate to "View
            program rules". This will open the list of existing rules, if any, for this
            program.
        </p>
    <p>
            To <span class="bold"><strong>add</strong></span> a rule, click the "Add new" button in the
            top right corner. This will open the new rule screen. Provide a name, short name, code,
            description, value type, expression and list of actions for the rule.
        </p>
    <p>
            To <span class="bold"><strong>edit</strong></span> a rule, click on the relevant rule in the list 
            to open the context menu and click "Edit". This will open the edit rule screen, where you 
            can modify the relevant values.
        </p>
    <p>
            To <span class="bold"><strong>remove</strong></span> a rule, click on the relevant rule in the list 
            to open the context menu and click "Remove". Click "OK" in the confirmation dialog
            to remove the rule.

    <p>
            During data entry, program rules <span class="bold"><strong>expressions</strong></span> are evaluated
            each time the user interface is displayed, and each time a data element is changed. Most types
            of actions will take effect immediately as the user enters
            values in tracker or event capture.
        </p>
    <p>
            Each program rule is given a name and description (see section "Program rule details"). These 
            fields are not shown to the end user, and are only meant for the program administrator. The 
            active part of a program rule consists of an <span class="bold"><strong>expression</strong></span> (consult <a class="xref" href="#program_rules_expressions" title="31.5.&nbsp; Defining expressions">Section&nbsp;31.5, &#8220; Defining expressions &#8221;</a> for details) more <span class="bold"><strong>actions</strong></span>(see 
            section <a class="xref" href="#program_rules_defining_actions">Section&nbsp;31.6, &#8220; Defining actions &#8221;</a> for details) that will be performed if the expression
            is true. </p>
    <p>The expression is built from operators, user-defined static  values     and      and <span class="bold"><strong>source fields</strong></span>             (see <a class="xref" href="#program_dules_adding_source_fields">Section&nbsp;31.4, &#8220; Adding source fields &#8221;</a>  for details). The source fields
represent attribute and data element values which will be evaluated as part of  the 
            expression.

    <p>
            Source fields represent a uniform way to include data values 
            and attribute values in expressions. The 
                source fields is defined as needed when creating expressions           .  When creating your first expression, you will
            typically have to define one or more source fields first,
            as expressions usually contain at least one data element or attribute value to be meaningful.
            The source fields is shared between all rules in your program,
            and by creating several rules, these will share the same library of source 
                fields.

            To add a source field, click the "+ Add source field" button

    <p>
            Each program rule has a single expression that determines whether rules action should be triggered, if the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is true the program rule
            is in effect and the actions will be executed. If the 
            expression is false, the program rule is no longer in effect and the 
            actions will no longer be applied.
        </p>
    <p>
As a simple example, an expression is defined below  using a single user-define static value, 
                source fields(see previous chapter) and/or operators. Expressions
            can be typed into the edit expression text box, but buttons are available for inserting operators and
            source fields at the cursors position. To insert 
                source fields, click the source field name within the list at the
            left.

      <p>
                A hide field action is defined by selecting "Hide section" in the first column of the
                action row. 
            </p>

      <p>
                The second column is optional, and it allows defining a custom message to the end user in case the rule hides a section that 
                contains a field that again has a value. 
            </p>
      <p>
                If a hide section action hides a section with one 
                or more fields that contains a value, these fields will always be removed. If no message is defined, a standard message will 
                be displayed to alert the user.

      <p>
                A <span class="bold"><strong>show warning action</strong></span> is defined by selecting "show warning" in the first column of the
                action row. A show warning action is used to give the user
                a warning about the data being entered, but at the same time allowing the user to save and continue. Warnings can
                be used to help the user avoid errors in the data entered, while at the same time allowing the user to consciously disregard
                it and save a value that is outside preset expectations.

                The second column is mandatory, and is used to define the message shown to the user when the expression
                is true and the action is triggered.
            </p>
      <p>
                The third column specifies which data element or attribute to link the warning to, and is meant to be a recommendation to the user regarding
                where the cause of the warning can be rectified. In case several data elements or attributes are involved,  when defining the rule, you should choose the one that is most
                likely that the user would need to consider.

                A <span class="bold"><strong>show error action</strong></span> is defined by selecting "show error" in the first column of the
                action row. A show error action is used whenever there are rules which must strictly be adhered to. The show error action prevents the user from continuing until the error is resolved. Such
                a strict validation should only be used whenever it is certain that the evaluated expression is never
                true unless the user has made a mistake in data entry.

As an example, all the health facilities in a particular district would contribute to the total value for the particular district in question. Different aggregation operators are supported within DHIS2, such as SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Aggregate data</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>In the context of DHIS2, aggregate data refers to either data elements or indicators that have been derived from other hierarchical data sources. For instance, aggreagte facility data would result from the aggregate totals of all patients that have attended that facility for a particular service. Aggregate district data would result from the aggregate totals of all facilities contained with a particular district.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Application programming interface</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>An application programming interface is a specification of how different software components should interact with each other. The DHIS2 API (or WebAPI) can be used to interface DHIS2 with other software, to build reports or custom data entry forms. </p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv"><h3 class="title">B</h3><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">Bimonthly</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Refers to a two-month period, such as January 1st to February 28th.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv"><h3 class="title">C</h3><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">Category</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Categories are groups of category options.

Categories are typically a single type of concept, such as "Age" or "Gender". </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Category combinations</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Category combinations are used to disaggreate data elements. As an example, the data element "Number of confirmed cases of malaria" could be disaggregated subdivided into to categories:  "Age" and "Gender". In turn each of these categories, would consist of several category options, such as "Male" and "Female" for the gender category. Category combinations may consist of one or several categories. </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Category combination options</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Category combination options are dynamically composed of all of the different combinations of category options which compose a category combination. As an example, two categories "Gender" and "Age", might have options such as "Male"/"Female" and "&lt;5 years"/"&gt;5 years". The category combination options would then consist of:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>(Male/&lt;5 years)</td></tr><tr><td>(Male/&gt;5 years)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/&lt;5 years)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/&gt;5 years)</td></tr></table></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Category option</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Category options are atomic elements that are grouped into categories.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Comma separated values</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Comma separated values are series of tabular data stored in a plain-text format.

Datamart tables are used for analysis  and report production. Typically, users should not work directly with unaggregated data values, but rather with values that have resulted from a datamart export for analysis. </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Data element</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>A data element is the fundamental building block of DHIS2. It is an atomic unit of data with well-defined meaning. Essentially it is a data value that has been actually observed or recorded which is further characterized by a number of dimensions. As an example the data element "Number of fully immunized children" would refer to the number of children that received this particular service. Data elements are always linked to a period as as well as an organizational unit. They optionally may be linked to other dimensions. </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Data element group</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data elements according to a common theme, such as "Immunization" or "ART". Typically, they are used during reporting and analysis to allow related data elements to be analyzed together. </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Data element group sets</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data element groups into a common theme. </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Dimension</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>A dimension is used to categorize data elements during analysis. Dimensions provide a mechanism to group and filter data based on common characteristics. Typically, related data elements may be aggregated or filtered during analysis with the use of dimensions. Dimensions may be a member of a hierarchy. For instance the "Period" dimension may be broken down into "Day-&gt;Month-&gt;Quarter-&gt;Year". </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">DXF</span></dt><dd><p>See  Data exchange format.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv"><h3 class="title">H</h3><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">Health management information system</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Typically, an electronic database system that is used to record aggregated data on service delivery, disease incidence, human resource data and other information used to evaluate the performance of delivery of health services.
