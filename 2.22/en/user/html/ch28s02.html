    <p>To proceed with the tracker capture one needs to have a TEI. As shown in the screenshot
      below, the first page of the app provides two features for this - searching an existing one or
      registering a new one.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/search_register.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>All searching and registration operations are accessible from the screen shown above.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Searching: there are two modes of searching - simple and advanced. The simple one
            works by typing a free text on the provided area. What is typed in the input box is
            applied across all attributes for partial match. The advanced one, which is accessible
            when the small drop-down button is clicked - works when various search criteria are
            provided in the drop down window. Here, the match is exact match. Both search modes
            return matching list of TEI displayed in a table. </p>
          <p>If a program is selected, the app provides further filtering on the table based on
            enrollment status which are All, Active, Completed, Cancelled.  as shown below.</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            
            <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="20%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/enrollment_status.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
          </div>
          <p>The advanced search also provides one more additional feature. Under normal
            circumstances, advanced search is conducted for the selected orgunit (from left-hand
            side tree) and scope (which could be Selected, Immediate children or All children).  The
            left-hand side tree is generated based on the logged in user's assigned orgunits.
            However, there could be cases to search for a TEI from another orgunit (which is not
            neccessarily part of the assigned orgunits. To support such use case, advanced search
            provides another orgunit tree. The tree displayed here depends on the role that the
            logged in user has. If the user has role "Search Tracked Entity Instance in All Org
            Units" or "ALL", a tree with all available orgunits is provided other wise the tree
            displayed in advanced search is the same as the one on the left-hand side. Whichever
            tree (or hierarchy of orgunits) is provided, if an orgunit is selected in advanced
            search, the searching is conducted against this selected orgunit and scope.</p>
          
          <p>While in the TEI table, clicking on any row takes to the selected TEI's
            dashboard.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Registration: this is accessible through the "Register" button. During registration,
            it is possible to stay on the same page and keep doing more registration or go straight
            to the dashboard of the registered TEI. Selecting a program and doing registration also
            performs enrollment at the background. If a TEI is registered without a program, then
            enrollment is possible from the TEI dashboard. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during registration.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Both search and registration are dictated by a selected program. It is program attributes
      which are being used as search criteria, registration attributes and also as columns names for
      tracked entity list. If no program is selected, the system picks default attributes. If no
      search criteria is assigned for an attribute, then the attribute has no effect on searching.
      However to control the appearance or not of an attribute as a column list, one has to go
      through a menu available under the small gear icon. </p>
    <p>Once a TEI is obtained - either through searching or registration - the app presents the
      selected TEI's dashboard.</p>
