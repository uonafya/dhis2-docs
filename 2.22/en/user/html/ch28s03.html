    <p>All operations on a tracked entity are available from this dashboard. Anticipating
      multiple usecases or operations on registered TEI, we have structured the dashboard as a
      collection of widgets - more widgets can be added. This helps to scale and handle complexity
      while staying simple and clean. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/tei_dashboard.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>As shown in the figure above, the dashboard starts with four sets of menus at the top: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>back button - this helps to go back to the search and registration page</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>previous and next buttons - these are buttons to acces the previous/next TEI
            details</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>program selection menu - this is to dictate what kind of data to record and track
            for the selected TEI. This also affects the contents of the widgets.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>a small pin icon at the right corner - this allows to pin (or stick) the right side of
            the widgets. This is useful especially during data entry. If for example there are a
            many data elements or big form to fill, sticking the right side helps to remain visible
            while scrolling data entry part.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>a small gear icon at the right corner - currently three functionalities are
            available from this icon. 
            </p><div class="screenshot">
              
              <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="20%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/settings_icon.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
            </div><p>            
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                <p> Show/hide widgets - this helps to control which widgets to display. From the
                  figure above, there are eight widgets on display. The widgets are collapsible,
                  responsive and draggable - this helps to acquire optimal view area as per user
                  needs. Widget (re)arrangments are saved automatically per user per program.
                </p>
              </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Save dashboard layout as default - widgets arrangement is saved automatically
                  everytime a widget's position or state (expand/collapse) is changed. However, for
                  the entrie layout to be considered a default layout for the selected program it is
                  required to explicitly save as "Default layout". </p>
              </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Set tei to active/inactive - this has nothing to do with widgets or the
                  dashboard but it helps to set the status of dashborad owner (the TEI) to either
                  active or inactive. If a TEI is set to inactive, only read operations are allowed
                  - no data entry, no profile editing, no enrollment.</p>
              </li></ol></div>
        </li></ul></div>
    <p> The widgets:- </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Enrollment</strong></span> - this helps to enroll the TEI for the
            selected program. If an active enrollment already exists, the widget automatically
            displays it with some details about it. The widget also helps to do some operations on
            the selected enrollment - for example terminate/complete or a possibility to mark the
            enrollment for followup. The later one helps for example to deal with high-risk cases
            during pregnancy followup. A link to history is also provided if the TEI has historical
            enrollment.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Indicators</strong></span> - any indicator defined for the selected
            program will have its value cacluated and displayed under this widget. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataentry</strong></span> - this is for doing data entry using
            either default or custom forms. Depending on program definition, in particular program
            stages, events will be displayed in a timely fashion. Clicking on any of them displays
            the corresponding data entry. If a stage needs new event, a plus icon is displayed for
            new event creation. To proceed with data entry, it is mandatory to have event date. Once
            an event date is specified it is not possible to change due date. The assumption is that
            by specifying event date, the event has already taken place. If the event hasn't
            occurred yet, it is possible to change due date - this is effectively doing nothing but
            rescheduling. The buttons at the bottom help to change the status of a selected event.
            Another key feature from this widget is addition of multiple notes for an event.
            Normally data recording is through datalements, however there are cases where it is
            necessary to record additional information or comments. This is where the notes section
            comes handy. However, a interesting feature here is - it is not possible to delete a
            note. The idea is notes are more like log books. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during data entry.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notes</strong></span> - this is the same as event notes. The
            difference between the two is that, here notes are attached not to events but to
            enrollments. This helps to record some notes based on enrollment - for example why is an
            enrollment terminated or what is the overall observation of the TEI throughout the
            enrollment.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Report</strong></span> - this is to provide a "journal" of the TEI
            per program. A report row is provided for each program the TEI is/was associated.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Profile </strong></span> - this is to edit TEI's profile or
            attributes. Here, if the TEI has an attribute of value type "Tracker Associate", a small
            icon next to the input filed is displayed. Clcking the icon opens a popup where users
            are allowed to either search or register new associate.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Active programs</strong></span> - this is an extension of the
            enrollment widget. While the enrollment widget displays both active and historical
            enrollment for the selected program, active programs widget displayes all other programs
            that the selected TEI has active enrollments.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="bold"><strong>Relationship </strong></span> - this helps to relate the selected
            TEI (the one whose dashboard is shown) to another TEI. Adding a relative is possible by
            either searching from existing or registering a new one. If a program is selected while
            registering a new one, the new one will be automatically enrolled to the selected
            program. Another interesting feature in the relationship widget is attribute
            inheritance. For example take Mother-Child relationship and assume there are two
            programs Antenatal care for the mother and Immunization for the child. If among others
            first name, last name and address attributes are required for both programs, it is
            possible to configure last name and address attributes as inheritable. Then during child
            registration, there is no need to refill these inheritable attributes - they can be
            automatically populated based on the mother's value. If for some reason a different
            value is required for the child, it is possible to override.</p>
