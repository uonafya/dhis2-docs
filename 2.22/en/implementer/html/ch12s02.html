    <p>Once you have assigned a data set to an organisation unit that data set will be made available in Data Entry (under Services) for the organisation units you have assigned it to and for the valid periods according to the data set's period type. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with categories such as age groups or gender, then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the categories. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</p>

      <p>DHIS 2 currently features three differnet types of forms which are described in the following.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e936"></a>12.2.1.1.&nbsp;Default forms</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>A default data entry form is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with a non-default category combination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions.
If you use more than one category combination in a data set you will get one table per category combination in the default form, with different column headings for the options. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e939"></a>12.2.1.2.&nbsp;Section forms</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table (e.g. some categories do not apply to all data elements), both of these functions are supported in section forms. After defining a data set you can define it's sections with subsets of data elements, a heading and possible grey fields i the section's table. The order of sections in a data set can also be defined. In Data Entry you can now start using the Section form (should appear automatically when sections are available for the selected data set).  Most tabular data entry forms should be possible to do with sections forms. Utilizing the section or default forms makes life easy as there is no need to maintain a fixed form design which includes references to data elements. If these two types of forms are not meeting your requirements then the third option is the completely flexible, although more time-consuming, custom data entry forms.</p>

      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e942"></a>12.2.1.3.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in terms of the design. In DHIS 2 there is a built in HTML editor (CK Editor) in the form designer which allows you to either design the form in the GUI or paste in your html directly (using the "source" window in the editor). In the custom form you can insert static text or data fields (linked to data elements + category option combination) in any position on the form and you have complete freedom to design the layout of the form. Once a custom form has been added to a data set it will be available in data entry and used automatically. </p>
        <p>When using a custom form it is possible to use calculated fields to display e.g. running totals or other calculations based on the data captured in the form. This can e.g. be useful when dealing with stock or logistics forms that need item balance,  items needed for next period etc. In order to do so, the user must first define the calculated expressions as indicators and then assign these indicators to the data set in question. In the custom form designer the user can then assign indicators to the form the same way data elements are assigned. The limitation to the calculated expression is that all the data elements use in the expression must be available in the same data set since the calculations are done on the fly inside the form, and are not based on data values already stored in the database.</p>
