    <p>Most of the objectives mentioned in the roll out section depends heavily on appropriate user training. User training can be conducted in several ways. An effective activity, especially for getting started, is training workshops. Users such as district and province record officers, district managers, data entry officers and health program managers are gathered and given training. Training should be done as a combination of theoretical lectures and hands-on practise on relevant subjects mentioned in the roll out section such as data entry, validation and analysis. Participants should be kept at a manageable number depending on the facilities and number of trainers available. Sufficient hardware for all participants to do practical work must be provided.</p>
    <p>Another useful activity is on-the-job training which has the advantage that users get individual follow-up in their home working environment. This provides the ability to help with individual specific needs or questions and sort any issues related to hardware. Also, giving individual support will often boost the motivation and ownership feeling of end users. </p>
    <p>The period between a workshop and on the-the-job training can be used for home work assignments, where users typically are assigned to create meaningful analysis for their district or province. This work can then be given feedback on and used as basis for individual training.</p>
