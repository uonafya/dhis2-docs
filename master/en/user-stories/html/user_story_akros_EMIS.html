    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Who is involved in this program?</strong></span>
        This program is our latest project; it began in 2016. In partnership with the Ministry of General Education with support from UNICEF, Akros has developed and implemented an Education Management Information System (EMIS) in Namwala District, Zambia using DHIS2.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What did the situation look like before this initiative?</strong></span>Prior to this EMIS, the ministry depended on annual reports from schools that were put into a Microsoft Access database. The yearly reporting prevented data capture of critical education information like attendance or quarterly standardized exam scores. This placed significant limitation in terms of the data available to the ministry for decision and policy making at all levels</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>No reliable attendance data.</strong></span>Prior to EMIS, yearly enrollment
            information was the only indicator available for the number of students going to school.
            As a result, the average daily attendance was often significantly different from
            enrollment figures. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What type of data is being reported with DHIS2?</strong></span>As mentioned, we&#8217;re capturing aggregate data on a monthly basis that shows us the enrollment and attendance figures of teachers and students. We also capture Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) information.  We&#8217;re retrieving exam scores in literacy and numeracy, and lastly, we&#8217;re getting data on school feeding days and the commodities being consumed. For event capture, we&#8217;re gathering termly data about the drop-out rate of teachers and students and commodity requests for education materials, pens, textbooks, etc.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>An example of an EMIS indicator:</strong></span>To work out the percentage of
            enrolled students attending classes, the indicator is calculated by adding all students
            attending class every day divided by the number of teaching days that month.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>How well is the EMIS system doing?</strong></span>We&#8217;re making progress in areas such as helping teachers and chiefs to understanding the importance of data and accountability. Participants are becoming more aware of how standardized reporting generates consistent results. The decision-making data we&#8217;ve retrieved, in areas such as real-time attendance and learner outcome data, is more reliable than ever before. For example, the ministry can now see results as soon as exams are taken; interventions and teacher support can be immediately developed based on exam scores. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>And the challenges?</strong></span>There was only yearly paper reporting prior to EMIS and so we&#8217;ve had a bit of a learning curve to address in terms of getting participants comfortable using a tablet to enter data with a matrix presentation. We&#8217;re striving to keep the data simple; we&#8217;ve moved from 27 pages of data down to 1 monthly report and one termly report. However, some paper trail still remains. Finally, we&#8217;re facing a challenge with the low capacity of data entry personnel available</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>What&#8217;s ahead?</strong></span>We&#8217;re keen on setting up feedback loops that include teachers, Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs), chiefs, and district officers. We&#8217;d like to have standardized dashboards in place and data quality assessment tools that include validation rules and standard operating procedures. We&#8217;re hoping to implement national level reports. Finally, we wish to scale to additional districts in Zambia. A lot to think about!</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>
