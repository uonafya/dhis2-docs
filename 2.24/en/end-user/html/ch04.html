Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Standard reports:</strong></span> Standard reports are built on pivot tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF  files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataset reports:</strong></span> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Dashboard:</strong></span> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display  up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Data Visualizer:</strong></span> Do flexible visualizations of your data
      as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several
      chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The
      charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal
      dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Orgunit distribution reports:</strong></span> These reports are generated
      off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of
      health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports
      are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and
      downloads in PDF, excel, and CSV are available.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting rate summary:</strong></span> These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages  showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Web-based pivot tables:</strong></span> The built in pivot table tool is a  web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for pivoting manipulations of the tables. It allows for large amounts of data to be downloaded offline for analysis as well.  </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>GIS:</strong></span> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points.  See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into DHIS2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s06.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch04s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.6.&nbsp;Follow-Up Analysis&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_end_user_manual.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;Using standard reports</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
