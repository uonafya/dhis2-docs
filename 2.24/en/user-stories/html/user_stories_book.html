            defecation&#8212;a huge challenge for many governments. Akros is supporting the government in
            this goal through water, sanitation, and hygiene programs that use mobile surveillance
            technology at the community level. The community level data collection and feedback
            system, which relies on DHIS2, has demonstrated that over 2.5 million Zambians have
            gained access to adequate latrines in rural areas since 2014.</strong></span></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e10"></a>Zambia in a few words</h2></div></div></div><p>Zambia is a landlocked, primarily-rural country in sub-Saharan Africa. Of its ten
            provinces, eight are rural. The population relies on a mixture of construction,
            agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and other sectors for economic prosperity. However,
            in spite of recent economic growth, as of the 2013-2014 Demographic Health Survey more
            than half of the population did not have access to improved sanitation
            facilities.</p><p>

        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e26"></a>What is WASH?</h2></div></div></div><p>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, also called WASH, comprises several interrelated public health
            concerns such as access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and proper hygiene
            education. Carefully structured WASH programs can help increase life-expectancy and
            economic productivity.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e31"></a>Tackling Open Defecation</h3></div></div></div><p>Open defecation is a huge environmental health issue in developing countries such as Zambia.
                Defecating in the open, where flies can fly freely between food and feces, increases
                the risk of diarrhoeal diseases.</p><p>In an effort to eliminate open defecation, Akros has supported the Government of Zambia, UNICEF and other development partners to extend a DHIS2-based WASH data collection platform to more than 20,000 villages. This system enables government officials and local chiefs to monitor progress towards the elimination of open defecation in their wards and chiefdoms in real-time. Village-level WASH data has given local chiefs and government officials the ability to follow-up with specific villages that lag behind in the uptake of latrine construction and use&#8212;which, for the first time, has led to multiple open defecation free (ODF) districts in Zambia.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e38"></a>What is Akros?</h2></div></div></div><p>Akros is an NGO that is experienced in the design and implementation of surveillance systems.
            Akros supports the implementation of WASH programs in Zambia through low-cost feature
            phones and innovative feedback mechanisms. Akros supports community-level tracking of
            latrine construction and uptake across nine of Zambia&#8217;s 10 districts. <a class="link" href="http://www.akros.com" target="_top">www.akros.com</a>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e46"></a>Before DHIS2</h2></div></div></div><p>In 2012 UNICEF began making massive investments in Zambia with its Community-led Total
            Sanitation (CLTS) program, a methodology for mobilizing communities to completely
            eliminate open defecation (OD). This program, however, depended on paper records to be
            collected and physically delivered to the district level from the villages. This process
            could take 6 months or longer and left UNICEF, partners, and the Ministry of Local
            Government and Housing with stale and unusable data.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e51"></a>Utilizing DHIS2 for WASH</h2></div></div></div><p>When a Zambian-based consultant introduced the Akros country director to DHIS2, things took a
            swing in a different direction. DHIS2, or &#8220;District Health Information Software&#8221;, is a
            flexible, open source software platform used in more than 40 countries. With the help of
            dashboards, charts, pivot tables and maps, DHIS2 makes data aggregation and data
            visualization very easy to create, understand and share. <a class="link" href="http://www.dhis2.org/" target="_top">http://www.dhis2.org/</a></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e57"></a>Scaling up DHIS2-WASH from 2013 to 2016</h3></div></div></div><p>In 2013, Akros implemented its first DHIS2 pilot for the WASH project. Thereafter, the electronic WASH surveillance system was scaled to additional districts with a vision of eliminating OD countrywide. Currently the CLTS project has been implemented in 70 districts using the DHIS2 platform. </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e62"></a>Stage 1: Champions at the grass roots level</h4></div></div></div><p>Local stakeholders have played a key role in community level sensitization campaigns that
                    highlight the dangers of OD. With guidance from the Government of Zambia and
                    other partners supporting CLTS, at the village level, volunteers form Sanitation
                    Action Groups (SAGs). These volunteers are equipped with CLTS data collection
                    sheets and collect data on household sanitation, trachoma monitoring, and
                    available access to clean water. Typical survey questions cover areas such as
                    the existence of a latrine in a household and if that latrine is equipped with a
                    lid; access to hand washing and water, soap, or ash; access to bathing shelters;
                    the availability and cleanliness of drinking water, and so forth. SAGs work
                    closely with selected individuals called Community Champions (CCs), who collect
                    data from the SAGs and aggregate and submit the data through their mobile phones
                    to DHIS2.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/images/use_cases/data_collection_forms.png"></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e71"></a>Stage 2: Reporting</h4></div></div></div><p>The collected paper-based data is checked by the Community Champions. The data is then
                    submitted via a hand-held device, usually a low-end feature phone that runs a
                    DHIS-J2ME platform, to the next level in the process; the Environmental Health
                    Technicians (EHTs). Thanks to Java technology, the cost of sending data via the
                    DHIS-J2ME platform works out to be ten times cheaper than using standard text messages.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e76"></a>Stage 3: Troubleshooting and verifying data</h4></div></div></div><p>Once a Community Champion submits aggregated data through their mobile phones, this data is
                    made available to all key stakeholders who receive automated HTML performance
                    reports on a given village. The data is then reported to the next level, the
                    village chief, via an Android DHIS2 app.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/use_cases/mobile_phone.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e85"></a>Stage 4: Data through the Chief&#8217;s eyes</h4></div></div></div><p>With the help of a Data Viewing Widget on a tablet, referred to as the &#8220;Chief App&#8221;, the
                    village chief is able to look at the data that his advisors have gathered and
                    make decisions based on what he sees. The chief holds his headmen accountable
                    for any irregularities that could reduce his influence or impinge his
                    reputation. The chief may at times carry out sanctions against underperforming
                    headsmen, or on the contrary, give incentives, typically in the form of mobile
                    phone credit, to high performers.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/use_cases/chief_looking_at_data.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e94"></a>Stage 5: District monitoring</h4></div></div></div><p>At the district-level the CLTS Focal Point Person (FPP), logs on to DHIS2 on a monthly basis to monitor ward and village propagation of improved latrines and progression towards ODF status. This person also shares relevant information with the District Commissioner and Town Planner.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e99"></a>Stage 6: Quarterly ward meetings and ODF status</h4></div></div></div><p>Each ward has a quarterly CLTS meeting to allow representatives from all the villages in the ward to discuss challenges and share successes towards latrine propagation and progress towards achieving ODF status. The event serves to engage the SAGs to continue community sensitization towards achieving ODF status.</p><p>On a monthly basis, CCs and EHTs track ODF status of villages in their wards through their mobile phones, and district officials track ODF status of villages through their DHIS2 dashboard. The CC, EHT or district official can select a particular village from a drop-down list, and can see a bar from 0% to 100% indicating the status of that village in working towards 100% ODF.</p><p>Once a village achieves ODF and is verified, the District CLTS FPP logs on to DHIS2 and selects &#8220;ODF Verified&#8221; next to the village&#8217;s name, which changes the color of the village name to green.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e108"></a>Working in a tribal context</h3></div></div></div><p>Zambia is a hierarchical society with strict codes about status. There are roughly 150
                chiefdoms. The traditional village chiefs are in charge of all the decisions in the
                village and very little can be achieved without their approval. They are the
                custodians of the villagers; ensuring their health and social-economic well-being.
                Communicating about DHIS2 and obtaining meaningful results required bringing
                onboard the chiefs within each village. Introducing technology through the means of
                a tablet was, in some cases, a huge yet surmountable change for certain
                chiefs.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e113"></a>Maintaining an active interest</h3></div></div></div><p>As the WASH project got underway, a spirit of competition started to emerge amongst village chiefs. Vying for the best results, the chiefs soon became actively involved in overseeing the implementation and follow up of WASH-related activities within their communities. Thanks to automated DHIS2 data feedback loops such as SMS messages, customized dashboards, PDF reports and the Chief&#8217;s data visualization widget that could be interpreted extremely easily, even illiterate participants could access the trends and progress of their community&#8217;s efforts.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e118"></a>Choice of phone technology</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the first challenges that came up was to get participants up to speed using mobile phone technology. Initially, participants were given Galaxy smartphones to work with, but this soon proved to be a bad choice. The design of the menus and complexity of certain applications was completely baffling to some. Even typing with a touchscreen was challenging for certain participants, who had never used a touchscreen phone. Also, due to the sensitivity of the touchscreens, participants would inadvertently change the phone settings, such as the keyboard layout to a different language, and not know how to revert the situation. Applications running in the background would also consume too much of the phone&#8217;s resources. In sum, due to their limited battery-life, fragile screens, interface complexity and highly coveted appearance, smartphones had to be replaced. Low-tech yet robust feature phones that could run DHIS2 Java-based applications were introduced. Reporting soon rocketed as a result of this turnaround and the progress of the WASH program instantly improved.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e123"></a>Rollout and Adaptation</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e126"></a>Clear, simple processes</h3></div></div></div><p>Keeping the DHIS2-WASH system simple to use and clear to understand at all levels was the key
                to its successful implementation. Data collection forms, such as the one in the
                example below, can be completed very easily by community volunteers who retrieve
                information in each village.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="resources/images/use_cases/new_wash_collectionform.png" align="middle"></div></div><p>By keeping data collection sheets simple, by using clear data indicators, this meant that the data entered in to the system was also clear and only critical information was retained. As a result, analyzing and interpreting the data was much more straightforward. Another benefit of using very basic indicators was that any errors that slipped into the data could be spotted and rectified fairly simply. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e137"></a>Defining Roles</h3></div></div></div><p>Akros has created three detailed end-user capacity assessments: the Stakeholder Role Rubric, the CLTS Surveillance Protocol and the CLTS Events Protocol. These documents serve the purpose of defining what each person does within a program so as to avoid ambiguity about responsibilities. Furthermore, the documents help to improve, monitor and assess the implementation of CLTS programs at the different roll out stages.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e142"></a>Stakeholder Role Rubric</h4></div></div></div><p>This document can enable a Community Health Worker to understand the full scope of his or her role. For example, they would know that they would be in charge of decision making in areas covering disease diagnosis, treatment administration, patient referrals, and commodity resupply checks. They would also know about the reporting requirements to follow such as the frequency and method to use.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e147"></a>CLTS Surveillance Protocol</h4></div></div></div><p>The Surveillance Protocol is a document that is used to assign monitoring methodologies for each event. It is a detailed analysis of surveillance techniques against each critical event in CLTS deployment. Responsible parties, periodicity, the role of automated functions and manual (surveillance officer) functions are all identified.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e152"></a>CLTS Events Protocol</h4></div></div></div><p>The CLTS Events Protocol is a document with a more detailed description of the critical events to be monitored. Responsible parties, periodicity, purpose and expected outcomes are identified, along with a brief narrative for context. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e157"></a>Promote a sense of responsibility</h3></div></div></div><p>Promoting a sense of data ownership amongst participants has a great influence in helping to build up sustainable programs. It is therefore important to develop standard operating roles, by outlining the tasks and duties of every person interacting with the system.</p><p>Thus by making participants feel responsible for the data they&#8217;re in charge of and by promoting how their role is connected to the successful outcome of a CLTS project, this helps to maintain the flow of communication between all of the levels involved, whether it be at village, ward, constituency, district, province, national or organizational level.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e164"></a>Lessons learned</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e167"></a>Backwards compatibility</h4></div></div></div><p>Everything has to be backwards compatible to make upgrades into a smoother process. For example, in 2013, DHIS2 version 2.1.4 was unable to handle the growing volume of users as more and more districts started to use WASH. The system had to be upgraded, due to the number of legacy issues and bugs that were encountered. However, this was not a straightforward task and meant re-installing applications on all devices.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e172"></a>Using clones of tried and tested WASH programs</h4></div></div></div><p>Akros learned that it was beneficial to use clones of production instances as a means to ensure stable implementations of WASH. Upgrades were performed on the cloned instances and then upgrades were applied to the production instances. By proceeding in this anticipatory manner, costs were kept down and troubleshooting was reduced.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e177"></a>Use data to drive decision making</h4></div></div></div><p>Using DHIS2-WASH is one thing; in fact it&#8217;s the easiest part. Getting people to use the data in order to drive decision making is the real challenge. To achieve this, Akros made it clear that all participants in a program should understand their role, responsibility and their intrinsic value within the program. Creating a sense of data ownership and a sense of accountability was therefore crucial. For example, by generating DHIS2 reports, district officers had the possibility to make comments about areas of improvement within their district. This information was then forwarded to a provincial coordinator who took action at his or her level.</p><p> Lastly, by ensuring that communication channels remained active and were maintained, Akros
                    was able to see how their CLTS program took on more importance and credibility,

PSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local organizations to create health solutions that are built to last.</p><p>More than 8,900 staff work for PSI and its affiliates. Its world headquarters are in Washington, D.C. and its European offices are in Amsterdam. PSI works in more than 60 countries. In 2014, PSI&#8217;s revenue was calculated at $631,229,922 USD.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e203"></a>Why did you choose DHIS2 at PSI, what drove the decision?</h2></div></div></div><p>In 2011, PSI began its search for a better Management Information System (MIS). Until then, we&#8217;d been using a different MIS in every country and even within countries, different MISs would be used for different projects. We were stuck with highly customized &#8220;boutique&#8221; systems &#8211; that is, unique data collection systems for every project. This was a mix of a Microsoft Excel, Access, and other tools. Programs were cobbling together pieces of information to see trends and analyze their programs. Accessing data like this wasn&#8217;t very efficient.</p><p>All of these unique, siloed systems led PSI to reflect upon two larger questions: how does PSI want to engage with its information, both locally and globally? And how do we want data to influence both the strategic and everyday program questions that PSI tackles?</p><p>During its search for a new, global MIS, several different systems were considered but in the end, DHIS2 was chosen for its ability to collect, manage, and visualize information&#8230;in essence, it was the system that made it easier for our programs to collect information and make decisions based off of data. It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful and flexible resource!</p><p>We were attracted to DHIS2&#8217;s ability to collect info on-the-go and the system&#8217;s ability to meet different needs. For example, users can set up their own entry forms, indicators and reports. DHIS2 is easily integrated with other interfaces; we especially liked that data collection and monitoring can be adapted for all program areas, including referrals, health services, sales and distribution.</p><p>Globally, PSI is making a huge push to make evidence-based decision-making easier for the
            field, and DHIS2 is a very tangible tool in that sense. Capturing and analyzing
            real-time data for decision making is appealing and relevant for our field programs and
            organizationally, it reinforces how PSI&#8217;s programs are truly data-driven.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/use_cases/psi_cambodia_workshop.jpg" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e225"></a>How did you roll out DHIS2? Was it a gradual process, district by district for example? </h2></div></div></div><p>No, we did it in true PSI fashion; we dived right in! We started with two pilot projects that were rolled out nationwide: one in Kenya and one in El Salvador. It was a huge benefit to have a low-complexity country like El Salvador and a high-complexity country like Kenya using DHIS2.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e230"></a>Kenya pilot project</h3></div></div></div><p>Kenya was PSI&#8217;s largest pilot project for DHIS2. All the projects are now reporting on DHIS2. It was a very exciting process, as it was PSI&#8217;s first time implementing DHIS2 at scale. In Kenya, there&#8217;s a wide range of programs on DHIS2, including malaria, HIV, family planning, social franchising, hypertension, sales, cervical cancer, and others.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e235"></a>El Salvador pilot project</h3></div></div></div><p>In El Salvador, PSI&#8217;s reproductive health program was the first to join DHIS2. This helped
                monitor the effectiveness of interpersonal communication, quality assurance visits,
                provider performance, and helped the team identify trends and where to direct
                resources. I was a part of the El Salvador team at the time, and it was incredible
                to see how program managers and supervisors began using DHIS2 during meetings to
                illustrate trends, gaps, and program needs.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/use_cases/psi_scale.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e244"></a>How many PSI countries are using DHIS2  2?</h2></div></div></div><p>After setting up our two pilot projects, DHIS2 grew very quickly at PSI&#8230;we created demand for this system and needed to meet other countries&#8217; requests to introduce DHIS2. From 2013 until now, PSI has over 20 countries reporting their data using DHIS2 on the production server and several more are in development. Over 60 PSI countries use DHIS2 to report their monthly aggregated health services data. With such a powerful tool, program managers can make better, data-driven decisions, which ultimately translates into improved programming.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e249"></a>What are the differences between how PSI uses DHIS2 and how the Ministries of Health do?</h2></div></div></div><p>PSI and MoHs are using the same MIS, that is to say DHIS2, but they are not using the same server. This means that the information on PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 server and the information on the MoH&#8217;s DHIS2 server are managed separately. Since PSI and the MoH capture different information, PSI&#8217;s is not creating a parallel system to the MoH. However, it enables the potential to share the information gathered by the other. In a few countries, MoHs have access to the information collected by PSI in their DHIS2  2 server.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e254"></a>How is DHIS2 making changes to its programs and businesses?</h2></div></div></div><p>DHIS2 could be used as just another MIS for data collection, but fortunately it&#8217;s used for so much more. What we&#8217;re really interested in is seeing the programs using the information on DHIS2 to influence their program decision making.</p><p>This is also part of a larger behavior change process to make better use of data and we&#8217;re
            asking ourselves:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>How do we make sure that program managers are using this information to direct where resources should be better used?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who should we target to use information to drive changes within programs
                        and ensure that evidence-based decision-making is being applied?</p></li></ul></div><p>DHIS2 has enabled us to see how we&#8217;re performing in various areas of Behavior Change Communication (BCC). For example, we&#8217;ve better visibility on what our Interpersonal Communication (IPC) agents are doing. We can see the number of people that IPC agents have reached, the BCC activities that are taking place, and so forth.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e270"></a>How do you implement DHIS2? Do you use consultants or local PSI teams?</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e273"></a>Local PSI DHIS2 stars</h3></div></div></div><p>We&#8217;re working closely with PSI&#8217;s country teams so they feel empowered to use, manage, and analyze their data using DHIS2. During DHIS2 implementations, in-country DHIS2 stars are identified and PSI provides coaching and assistance to empower them to integrate data for decision making&#8212;and DHIS2!&#8212;into their every day program management.</p><p>We also identify local technical leads who can support DHIS2 maintenance and adapt the system
                to meet their teams&#8217; needs. For example, we&#8217;re implementing DHIS2 in Zimbabwe and
                have an amazing MIS star there. Our team is working closely with him, and he&#8217;s
                learning how to build and do the configuration himself&#8212;and this includes some pretty
                complex integrations. It&#8217;s exciting to see how DHIS2 is really owned by PSI
                Zimbabwe&#8212;the data in DHIS2 is theirs and they&#8217;re using it. This is the kind of goal
                we aspire to.</p><p>

To do this, PSI collaborates with &#8220;DHIS2 builders,&#8221; who do the technical configuration work&#8230;that is, building the DHIS2 system to match the DHIS2 blueprint, which is based on the PSI country team&#8217;s data use needs.</p><p>These DHIS2 builders are often HISP agencies in India, Vietnam, Uganda, West Africa, and
                Colombia. We also work with BAO Systems, the largest US-based DHIS2 consulting and
                hosting firm in North America, for configuration support.<a class="link" href="https://baosystems.com/" target="_top">https://baosystems.com/</a> As I mentioned before, we are also training PSI&#8217;s local DHIS2 stars to lead configurations.</p><p>To make sure DHIS2 configuration work meets PSI&#8217;s standards, DHIS2 builders are supervised by PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 Architects. The DHIS2 Architects are an important part of our team and are specialized PSI DHIS2 experts&#8212;they not only make sure PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 configurations are high quality, but they also train local DHIS2 stars and help DHIS2 builders to learn PSI&#8217;s standards so our configurations become more efficient.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e304"></a>Do you provide DHIS2 training to PSI staff?</h2></div></div></div><p>As part of our long-term sustainability goals, we&#8217;re offering more training opportunities for local PSI staff on DHIS2 administration and data use using DHIS2, as well as for DHIS2 builders so they familiarize themselves with PSI standards. Before, we would create these trainings a little on the fly because there were fewer countries, but now we&#8217;re starting to create more standard, ready-to-go training resources. This helps us to save time and improve our curriculum based off of experience&#8212;this is also part of our strategy to reach scale.</p><p>We also send PSI staff to the introductory and advanced trainings that HISPs offer.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e311"></a>Which parts of DHIS2 are you using the most?</h2></div></div></div><p>Probably the aggregate data forms. But I&#8217;d like to see PSI using Tracker even more&#8230;.it&#8217;s an incredibly flexible tool! More and more countries are using the DHIS2 tracking feature. You can look at individual data, register individual cases, track individual cases and then conduct surveys. This means that you can capture detailed information and then analyze this information, to get the bigger picture about what&#8217;s going on. </p><p>Within PSI, we have a large network of franchised clinics and there are ongoing discussions about the direction we want to take with electronic medical records and Clinic Management Information Systems. So&#8230;whatever solution we&#8217;re proposing needs to be DHIS-2 compatible. Now we&#8217;re at the point where we&#8217;re asking ourselves: What&#8217;s DHIS2&#8217;s limit? </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e318"></a>How do you go about customizing DHIS2? </h2></div></div></div><p>Right now we&#8217;re focusing on strengthening how we implement DHIS2 and the process we use. We&#8217;re identifying what needs to happen and when, and the information we need to understand how the PSI country team will use DHIS2. Each country has its unique configuration, but there are core business processes that remain the same. So we&#8217;re identifying how this connects to the information that we need to see and the decisions that we need to make. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e323"></a>What&#8217;s the general feedback you get on DHIS2?</h2></div></div></div><p>It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful tool, but it&#8217;s not necessarily intuitive to create your own form or how you create your own dashboard. Sometimes that can be a barrier for PSI country teams to make full use of DHIS2. We&#8217;re looking to make that easier, and we&#8217;re identifying who really needs to be able to do what with DHIS2. For example, does a senior manager really need to create her own dashboard, or is it OK that someone else does it for her, if she can access and see her dashboards? Based off of this, we can understand who needs to be trained on what. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e328"></a>How do you help DHIS2 users with the system?</h2></div></div></div><p>We&#8217;ve recently transitioned to BAO Systems to help PSI to field its Help Desk tickets. For example, if a user gets stuck with a dashboard query, they submit a ticket through the Help Desk, which is mainly answered by BAO, with support from PSI&#8217;s DHIS2 Architects. We try to have a local DHIS2 administrator in each PSI country we work in; this person can usually field basic questions, like how to reset a password, or intermediate ones, like how to create a new form. Questions in the Help Desk range from basic to advanced, like reporting a bug, which may need to be sent to Oslo.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e333"></a>Do you embed DHIS2 into other apps?</h2></div></div></div><p>Absolutely! In addition to using DHIS2 as our MIS, PSI develops custom reports and apps to make real time data collection and analysis even easier. Different apps address key strategic and technical areas, including franchise management and provider performance, improving network quality, and case surveillance (such as malaria). All the information collected via apps is directly pushed into DHIS2. Analytics are automatically updated, giving users real-time information and visual analytics that makes data-driven decision making easier. </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e338"></a>Health Network Quality Improvement System (HNQIS) app</h3></div></div></div><p>The HNQIS app was developed by PSI with the aim to improve network quality and provider
                performance. It&#8217;s an impressive app that responds to a very real program need: How
                do we improve the quality of care that providers deliver more effectively? It helps
                Quality Assurance (QA) officers plan their supervision routes and target
                low-performing providers with high client volume. QA officers use PSI- and
                MoH-approved checklists in the app to conduct assessments with PSI&#8217;s providers. QA
                officers can easily monitor trends in network quality and identify how best to
                allocate their time and resources to improve their providers&#8217; performance. This app
                can be used both on and offline.</p><p>

                so anyone who can use a smartphone can use it. Pharmacists and other health
                providers use this app to collect basic data points - like geographic location, type
                of malaria detected and age/gender of the client. This information helps PSI and our
                partners to track malaria cases, identify outbreaks and re-direct resources to where

        </p><p>Owing to a huge disparity between regions and districts in terms of geography,
            history, population, and infrastructure, some areas of Tanzania have no reliable roads,
            electricity, or access to the Internet. <a href="#ftn.d0e405" class="footnote" name="d0e405"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e408"></a>Moving from multiple tools to a unified system</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e411"></a>Before DHIS2</h3></div></div></div><p>Tanzania Mainland's first HIS began in the 90s as a paper-based system used at
                health facilities and district offices. Information was collected and processed with
                a Microsoft Access database. Without the intervention of external consultants hired
                by funding agencies, there weren't any strategies to sustain the system with
                upgrades or refresher training.</p><p>With a surge in demand for a HIS, the MoHSW was being put under strain. Lack of
                coordination led to fragmented vertical projects running side by side. This caused
                an unsustainable situation in which efforts were being duplicated as results weren&#8217;t
                being converged.</p><p>Around 2007, a plan called the Monitoring and Evaluation Strengthening Initiative
                was made by the MoSWH, UDSM, UiO and other partners. Its goal was to build a new,
                integrated HIS to provide reliable data for the ministry and other stakeholders. A
                new paper-based system combined with DHIS2 was introduced. <a class="link" href="http://www.dhis2.org" target="_top">http://www.dhis2.org</a></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e421"></a>Introducing an integrated HIS in Tanzania</h3></div></div></div><p>In 2010, the adaptation and implementation of a totally revised HIS began. This process was
                enabled by a flexible, standard solution and participatory approaches operating
                across all levels of the national health system. It was important to find a solution
                that would meet the demands of health managers, implementers, designers and
                decision-makers.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e426"></a>A gradual, national HIS rollout</h4></div></div></div><p>In 2011, the coastal region of Pwani was used as a testbed for paper-based data collection
                    tools and DHIS2. Over the next two years, revised systems were rolled out to
                    the remaining 24 regions and associated districts and health facilities of
                    Tanzania Mainland. On completion of this rollout, efforts were directed towards
                    the integration of all major vertical programs such as malaria, TB/leprosy, RCH,
                    HIV/AIDS into DHIS2. Along with the implementation process, training programs
                    were held for implementing partners, district and regional hospital staff, and
                    the MoHSW staff.</p><p>

                    HIS</h4></div></div></div><p>Here are some of the key areas we dedicated time and resources to:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e452"></a>Open-source philosophy</h5></div></div></div><p>The choice to apply open-source tools rather than going through a closed, commercial product ensured that the software remained collaborative with a more diverse and flexible scope of design. Furthermore, the involvement of the many health sector stakeholders and an open source community of developers implied that the system would be geared towards long-term sustainability rather than a short-term lifecycle, dependent on a company&#8217;s paid maintenance services.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e457"></a>Incremental, flexible, and scalable design</h5></div></div></div><p>DHIS2 was implemented in an incremental way, rather than in one go. Like that, issues could
                        be tackled directly during the rollout process, and implemented in direct
                        response to user feedback. The most glaring flaws were thus easily spotted
                        and a more stable and efficient system was built.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e462"></a>Standards for data collection</h5></div></div></div><p>We used a set of common data collection standards that covered data collection, reporting,
                        analysis, and quality procedures and tools. All informal tools were removed
                        and the recording of duplicate entries of data declined. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e467"></a>Participatory design</h5></div></div></div><p>A community of users such as managers from the HIS, supporting partners and implementers
                        exchanged emails, spoke on forums, and at workshops about how to make the
                        software more user-friendly. This helped implementers fine-tuned their
                        programs and ensure that DHIS2 was being used optimally.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e472"></a>Action-led research</h5></div></div></div><p>Students enrolled on PhD and MSc degree programs at UiO and UDSM conducted &#8220;action-led
                        research&#8221; that enabled them to participate in the roll-out of DHIS2 while
                        doing research. By doing so, they learned and documented best practices
                        about system customization, user support, training, and data
                        analysis.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e477"></a>Local capacity building</h5></div></div></div><p>People learned to troubleshoot DHIS2 software, and users were encouraged to assist each other
                        across many different organization levels and roles. By instilling a sense
                        of ownership and self-sufficiency, the gap between implementers and users
                        was thus reduced. Training focused on software usage, data analysis and
                        basic and advanced features of DHIS2 for health and data managers.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e482"></a>Using information guidelines and standards</h5></div></div></div><p>To drive decision-making and to reach national health goals, annual planned targets, and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), teams created processes on how to generate and use data efficiently. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e487"></a>Interoperability of DHIS2 with other systems</h5></div></div></div><p>Since 2014, DHIS2 has been integrated with other software systems, enabling health workers to cross-cut, analyze and share data across organizations.

                DHIS2, streamline all resources and HIS activities of all stakeholders and use the
                MoHSW as a lead organization. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e600"></a>Establish a trustworthy relationship</h3></div></div></div><p>Promote system and data ownership within the MoHSW. Encourage data sharing amongst the health
                programs and stakeholders to help develop a sense of trust in the routine HIS and
                the resources and capacity that can support it.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e605"></a>Build capacity at national, regional, and local levels</h3></div></div></div><p>A reliable system is maintained by well trained and knowledgeable people.
