All users (clients) connect to the online central server over the Internet using a web browser. This style of deployment currently benefits from the  huge investments in and expansions of mobile networks in developing countries. This makes it possible to access online servers in even the most rural areas using mobile Internet modems  (also referred to as <span class="italic">dongles</span>).  </p><p>This online deployment style has huge positive implications for the implementation process and application maintenance compared to the traditional offline standalone style:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Hardware: Hardware requirements on the end-user side are limited to a reasonably modern computer/laptop and Internet connectivity through a fixed line or a mobile modem. There is no need for a specialized server, any Internet enabled computer will be sufficient.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Software platform: The end users only need a web browser to connect to the online server. All popular operating systems today are shipped with a web browser and there is no special requirement on what type or version. This means that if severe problems such as virus infections or software corruption occur one can always resort to re-formatting and installing the computer operating system or obtain a new computer/laptop. The user can continue with data entry where it was left and no data will be lost.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Software application: The central server deployment style means that the application can be upgraded and maintained in a centralized fashion. When new versions of the applications are released with new features and bug-fixes it can be deployed to the single online server. All changes will then be reflected on the client side the next time end users connect over the Internet. This obviously has a huge positive impact for the process of improving the system as new features can be distributed to users immediately, all users will be accessing the same application version, and bugs and issues can be sorted out and deployed on-the-fly.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Database maintenance: Similar to the previous point, changes to the meta-data can be done on the online server in a centralized fashion and will automatically propagate to all clients next time they connect to the server. This effectively removes the vast issues related to maintaining an upgraded and standardized meta-data set related to the traditional offline deployment style. It is extremely convenient for instance during the initial database development phase and during the annual database revision processes as end users will be accessing a consistent and standardized database even when changes occur frequently.</p></li></ul></div><p>This approach might be problematic in cases where Internet connectivity is volatile or missing in long periods of time. DHIS2 however has certain features which requires Internet connectivity to be available only only part of the time for the system to work properly, such as the MyDatamart tool presented in a separate chapter in this guide.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch04s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Deployment Strategies&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;4.3.&nbsp;Hybrid deployment</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
