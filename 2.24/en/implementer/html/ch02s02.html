There is nothing really that limits the use to the health domain either, although use in other sectors are still very limited. As long as the data is collected by and orgunit, described as a data element (possibly with some disaggregation categories), and can be represented by a predefined period frequency, it can be collected and processed in DHIS2. This flexibility makes DHIS2 a powerful tool to set up integrated systems that bring together collection tools, indicators, and reports from multiple health programs, departments or initiatives. Once the data is defined and then collected or imported into a DHIS2 database, it can be analysed in correlation to any other data in the same database, no matter how and by whom it was collected. In addition to supporting integrated data analysis and reporting, this integrated approach also helps to rationalise data collection and reduce duplication.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Conceptual Design Principles&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.3.&nbsp;Data input != Data output</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
