Organisational units can be either a health facility or department/sub-unit providing services or an administrative unit representing a geographical area (e.g. a health district). </p><p>Organisation units are located within a hierarchy, also referred to as a tree. The hierarchy will reflect the health administrative structure and its levels. Typical levels in such a hierarchy are the national, province, district and facility levels. In DHIS2 there is a single organisational hierarchy so the way this is defined and mapped to the reality needs careful consideration. Which geographical areas and levels that are defined in the main organisational hierarchy will have major impact on the usability and performance of the application. Additionally, there are ways of addressing alternative hierarchies and levels as explained in the section called Organisation unit groups and group sets further down.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e1755"></a>10.1.&nbsp;Organisation unit hierarchy design</h2></div></div></div><p>The process of designing a sensible organisation unit hierarchy has many aspects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Include all reporting health facilities:</span> All health facilities which contribute to the national data collection should be included in the system. Facilities of all kinds of ownership should be incorporated, including private, public, NGO and faith-oriented facilities. Often private facilities constitute half of the total number of facilities in a country and have policies for data reporting imposed on them, which means that incorporating data from such facilities are necessary to get realistic, national aggregate figures.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Emphasize the health administrative hierarchy:</span> A country typically has multiple administrative hierarchies which are often not well coordinated nor harmonized. When considering what to emphasize when designing the DHIS2 database one should keep in mind what areas are most interesting and will be most frequently requested for data analysis. DHIS2 is primarily managing health data and performing analysis based on the health administrative structure. This implies that even if adjustments might be made to cater for areas such as finance and local government, the point of departure for the DHIS2 organisation unit hierarchy should be the health administrative areas. </p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Limit the number of organisation unit hierarchy levels:</span> To cater for analysis requirements coming from various organisational bodies such as local government and the treasury, it is tempting to include all of these areas as organisation units in the DHIS2 database. However, due to performance considerations one should try to limit the organisation unit hierarchy levels to the smallest possible number. The hierarchy is used as the basis for aggregation of data to be presented in any of the reporting tools, so when producing aggregate data for the higher levels, the DHIS2 application must search for and add together data registered for all organisation units located further down the hierarchy. Increasing the number of organisation units will hence negatively impact the performance of the application and an excessively large number might become a significant problem in that regard. </p><p>In addition, a central part in most of the analysis tools in DHIS2 is based around dynamically selecting the &#8220;parent&#8221; organisation unit of those which are intended to be included. For instance, one would want to select a province and have the districts belonging to that province included in the report. If the district level is the most interesting level from an analysis point of view and several hierarchy levels exist between this and the province level, this kind of report will be rendered unusable. When building up the hierarchy, one should focus on the levels that will be used frequently in reports and data analysis and leave out levels that are rarely or never used as this will have an impact on both the performance and usability of the application. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Avoid one-to-one relationships:</span> Another guiding principle for designing the hierarchy is to avoid connecting levels that have near one-to-one parent-child ratios, meaning that for instance a district (parent) should have on average more than one local council (child) at the level below before it make sense to add a local council level to the hierarchy. Parent-child ratios from 1:4 or more are much more useful for data analysis purposes as one can start to look at e.g. how a district&#8217;s data is distributed in the different sub-areas and how these vary. Such drill-down exercises are not very useful when the level below has the same target population and the same serving health facilities as the parent. </p><p>Skipping geographical levels when mapping the reality to the DHIS2 organisation unit hierarchy can be difficult and can easily lead to resistance among certain stakeholders, but one should have in mind that there are actually ways of producing reports based on geographical levels that are not part of the organisational hierarchy in DHIS2, as will be explained in the next section.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch09s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch10s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">9.3.&nbsp;Reporting a problem&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;Organisation unit groups and group sets</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
