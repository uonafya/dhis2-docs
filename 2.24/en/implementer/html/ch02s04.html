In DHIS2 we distinguish between Data Elements which describe the the raw data, e.g. the counts being collected, and Indicators, which are formula-based and describe calculated values, e.g. coverage or incidence rates that are used for data analysis. Indicator values are not collected like the data (element) values, but instead calculated by the application based on formulas defined by the users. These formulas are made up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator "Measles coverage &lt;1 year" is defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator ("Measles doses given to children under 1 year") and a denominator ("Target population under 1 year"). The indicator "DPT1 to DPT3 drop out rate" is a formula of 100 % x ("DPT1 doses given"- "DPT3doses given") / ("DPT1 doses given"). These formulas can be added and edited through the user interface by a user with limited training, as they are quite easy to set up and do not interfere with the data values stored in the database (so adding or modifying an indicator is not a critical operation).</p><p>Indicators represent perhaps the most powerful data analysis feature of the DHIS2, and all reporting tools support the use of indicators, e.g. as displayed in the custom report in the figure above. Being able to use population data in the denominator enables comparisons of health performance across geographical areas with different target populations, which is more useful than only looking at the raw numbers. The table below uses both the raw data values (Doses) and indicator values (Cov) for the different vaccines. Comparing e.g. the two first orgunits in the list, Taita Taveta County and Kilifi County, on DPT-1 immunisation, we can see that while the raw numbers (659 vs 2088)  indicate many more doses are given in Kilifi, the coverage rates (92.2 % vs 47.5 %) show that Taita Taveta are doing a better job immunising their target population under 1 year. Looking at the final column (Immuniz. Compl. %) which indicates the completeness of reporting of the immunisation form for the same period, we can see that the numbers are more or less the same in the two counties we compared, which tells us that the coverage rates can be reasonably compared across the two counties.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/implementation_guide/indicator_report.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.3.&nbsp;Data input != Data output&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.5.&nbsp;Maintain disaggregated facility-data in the database</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
