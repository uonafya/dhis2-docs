As shown in the screenshot
      below, the first page of the app provides two features for this - searching an existing one or
      registering a new one.</p><div class="screenshot"><p class="title"><b>Example: searching/registration</b></p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/search_register.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>All searching and registration operations are accessible from the screen shown above.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Searching: there are two modes of searching: simple and advanced.</p><p>The simple search works by typing a free text in the search field. What is typed in
            the input box is applied across all attributes for partial match. The advanced search,
            which is accessible when the small drop-down button is clicked - works when various
            search criteria are provided in the drop down window. Here, the match is exact
            match.</p><p>Both search modes present the search results in a table. While in the TEI table,
            click on a row to open the selected TEI's dashboard. Clicking <span class="bold"><strong>Back</strong></span> in the dashboard takes you back to the search result table.</p><p>If a program is selected, the app provides further filtering on the table based on
            enrollment status which are All, Active, Completed, Cancelled.  as shown below.</p><div class="screenshot"><p class="title"><b>Enrollment status filtering icons</b></p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="20%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/tracker_capture/enrollment_status.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>The advanced search also provides one more additional feature. Under normal
            circumstances, advanced search is conducted for the selected organisation unit (from
            left-hand side tree) and scope (which could be Selected, Immediate children or All
            children). The left-hand side tree is generated based on the logged in user's assigned
            organisation units. However, there could be cases to search for a TEI from another
            organisation unit (which is not necessarily part of the assigned organisation units. To
            support such use case, advanced search provides another organisation unit tree. The tree
            displayed here depends on the role that the logged in user has. If the user has role
            "Search Tracked Entity Instance in All Org Units" or "ALL", a tree with all available
            organisation units is provided other wise the tree displayed in advanced search is the
            same as the one on the left-hand side. Whichever tree (or hierarchy of organisation
            units) is provided, if an organisation unit is selected in advanced search, the
            searching is conducted against this selected organisation unit and scope.</p><p>If a program is selected, advanced search allows you to search on the incident date
            if the program has one.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Registration: this is accessible through the "Register" button. During registration,
            it is possible to stay on the same page and keep doing more registration or go straight
            to the dashboard of the registered TEI. Selecting a program and doing registration also
            performs enrollment at the background. If a TEI is registered without a program, then
            enrollment is possible from the TEI dashboard. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during registration.</p><p>For unique tracked entity attributes you can have the system automatically generate
            and assign numeric IDs. When registering tracked entity instances on web, the tracker
            capture registration form will then automatically be populated with a number in the
            given pattern. In tracker on Android, the ID generation is used to reserve a series of
            IDs for each Android device. This allows offline registration of tracked entity
            instances without risking duplicate IDs when syncing with the server.</p><p>You
            configure
            the system-generated identifiers in the <span class="bold"><strong>Program/Attributes</strong></span> app:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="bold"><strong>Apps</strong></span> &gt; <span class="bold"><strong>Program/Attributes</strong></span> &gt; <span class="bold"><strong>Tracked entity</strong></span>.
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select an attribute and click <span class="bold"><strong>Edit</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="bold"><strong>Automatically generated</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div><p>Both search and registration are dictated by a selected program. It is program attributes
      which are being used as search criteria, registration attributes and also as columns names for
      tracked entity list. If no program is selected, the system picks default attributes. If no
      search criteria is assigned for an attribute, then the attribute has no effect on searching.
      However to control the appearance or not of an attribute as a column list, one has to go
      through a menu available under the small gear icon. </p><p>Once a TEI is obtained - either through searching or registration - the app presents the
      selected TEI's dashboard.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch26.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch26.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch26s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;26.&nbsp;Using Tracker
