  <p>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</p>

    <p>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose <span class="italic">Users</span> from the "Apps" menu and then click "User" from the menu items on the left-hand pane.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You can search for specific user names in the user list by entering the name in the
          <span class="italic">Filter by name</span> field as shown above. Some non-standard
        functions are available by clicking on each user in the list:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_user_roles"></a>7.1.2.&nbsp;User role management</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>As part of creating a user name you are required to define the user
      role. Do so by clicking on <span class="italic">User Role</span> on the left side of
      the displayed screen. This will lead you to the User role management page where you can
      click on <span class="guibutton">Add new</span> to create a new role.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">

      </div>
      <p>The following screen will open and here in the first text box you
      need to give a <span class="italic">Name</span> of the Role such as Super User,      Admin User, etc. The
      second text box called <span class="italic">Description</span> gives more information about the
      type of User Role that is being created for e.g. State Admin User,
      District Data Entry.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/role_maintenance_page.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Next you will specify the particular data set(s) that are to be
      made available to the particular role. You will also need to specify the
      type of <span class="italic">Authority</span> to be given to the particular user. For each of the
      three options namely Datasets, Reports and Authorities user can select
      multiple options from the scroll down menu provided against each field.
      A user can choose multiple options either by moving them
      one-by-one.</p>
      <p>In order for particular users to be able to enter data, you must
      add them to both a dataset as well as an organisational unit level. You
      can also select multiple datasets individually by pressing the Ctrl key
      on the keyboard and clicking on individual datasets.</p>
      <p>Finally when you have entered the required fields click on
      <span class="guibutton">Save</span> which is located on the lower part of the
      displayed screen. The desired user role and related authorisation will
      be saved to the database, and can then be assigned to a particular
      user.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_management"></a>7.1.3.&nbsp;User management</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Under particular user role there can be more than one user. To manage
      users, click on <span class="italic">User</span> on the left side of the screen.
      This will lead you to the <span class="italic">User management</span> page.</p>

              empty, then the user may choose their own username when they respond to the invitation (as long as it
              is not taken already for another user.)</p>
              <p>After you finish adding the new user, two emails will be sent to the address you provided. One contains
              a unique web link by which the user can return to the system and activate their account by entering the rest of their
              user information. The other email contains a unique code that they must enter into the system in order to
              complete the registration, after following the link in the first email. The user must finish setting up the account within three months, or the invitation

            as well as all of the facilities contained within the district. The data approval organisation

          from other groups, assign <span class="italic">Implementing Partner</span> to this user. This insures that any data visible to the user

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1565"></a>7.1.5.&nbsp;Managed users</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 supports a concept for user management referred to as <span class="italic">managed users</span> which which allows to explicitly define which users should be
        allowed to manage or modify which users. To "manage a user" implies that you can see and
        modify that user. The basic concept for user management is that you can see and modify users
        which you have been granted all of the authorities; in other words you can modify users
        which have a subset of your own authorities. The managed users concept gives you greater
        control over this.</p>
      <p>The managed users concept allows you to define which users should be able to manage
        which users. This is configured through user groups and memberships within such groups. A
        user group can be configured to be allowed to manage other user groups from the standard add
        and update user interface. The effect is that a specific user can manage all users which are
        members of user groups which can be managed by a user group that the user is member of. In
        other words, users can be managed by all members of user groups which are managing user
        groups they are member of.</p>
      <p>To enable this concept you should grant users the authority to "Add/update users within
        managed groups", and <span class="italic">not</span> grant access to the standard
        "Add/update users" authority. An implication of the managed users concept is that when
        creating a user with the "Add/update users within managed groups" only, the user must be
        made a member of at least one user group that the current user can manage. If not, the
        current user would lose access to the user being created immediately. This is validated by
        the system.</p>
      <p>When granted the "Add/update users within managed groups" authority, the
        system lets a user add members to user groups for which she has read-only access to. The
        purpose of this is to allow for desentralized user management. You may define a range of
        user groups where other users may add or remove members, but not remove or change the name
        of the group.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1573"></a>7.1.6.&nbsp;OpenID Support</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 supports the OpenID standard, which allows third party login using a OpenID
        provider, please see <a class="ulink" href="http://openid.net" target="_top">http://openid.net</a> for more
        information. To create a custom OpenID URL for a username you can visit this URL and log in
        with your OpenID provider: <a class="ulink" href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com" target="_top">http://openid-provider.appspot.com</a>.</p>
      <p>To enable support for this in DHIS 2, two steps must be done:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Set your OpenID provider</strong></span>: This can be done inside
              system settings, under "Access". Here you can set both the OpenID provider, and also
              the label to display on the login page to login with this provider (defaults to Login
              with OpenID).</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Set the OpenID identifier on the user</strong></span>: For every

              this on the user itself. This can be done in user management, under the email field,
              there is noe a field called <span class="italic">OpenID</span> which can be
              used to fill in the OpenID identifier. </p>
