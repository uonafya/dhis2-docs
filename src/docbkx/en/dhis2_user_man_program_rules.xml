  <title>Program rules</title>
  <para>This chapter covers how to configure and use program rules. Program rules provide a means to
    control dynamic behavior of the user interface in tracker and event capture. Program rules are
    based on expressions composed of data elements and attributes of tracked entities.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The purpose of program rules is to provide a way to produce complex dynamic behaviors in
      tracker and event capture. The program rules enables the programs to respond to data values
      entered in a program. The behaviors that can be configured as of now is skip logic and
      validation rules. Program rules is consisting of one <emphasis role="bold"
        >expression</emphasis>, and one or more <emphasis role="bold">actions</emphasis> that is
      triggered in the user interface when the <emphasis role="bold">expression</emphasis> is true.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Setup</title>
    <para> Program rules can be managed from the &quot;Programs and Attributes&quot; app. Once in
      the app, navigate to Programs. A program rule belongs to exactly one program, so click on the
      program for which you want to manage rules and from the context menu navigate to &quot;View
      program rules&quot;. This will open the list of existing rules, if any, for this program. </para>
    <para> To <emphasis role="bold">add</emphasis> a rule, click the &quot;Add new&quot; button in
      the top right corner. This will open the new rule screen. Provide a name, short name, code,
      description, value type, expression and list of actions for the rule. </para>
    <para> To <emphasis role="bold">edit</emphasis> a rule, click on the relevant rule in the list
      to open the context menu and click &quot;Edit&quot;. This will open the edit rule screen,
      where you can modify the relevant values. </para>
    <para> To <emphasis role="bold">remove</emphasis> a rule, click on the relevant rule in the list
      to open the context menu and click &quot;Remove&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot; in the
      confirmation dialog to remove the rule. </para>

    <title>Program rule anatomy</title>
    <para> During data entry, program rules <emphasis role="bold">expressions</emphasis> are
      evaluated each time the user interface is displayed, and each time a data element is changed.
      Most types of actions will take effect immediately as the user enters values in tracker or
      event capture. </para>
    <para> Each program rule is given a name and description (see section &quot;Program rule
      details&quot;). These fields are not shown to the end user, and are only meant for the program
      administrator. The active part of a program rule consists of an <emphasis role="bold"
        >expression</emphasis> (consult <xref linkend="program_rules_expressions"/> for details)
      more <emphasis role="bold">actions</emphasis>(see section <xref
        linkend="program_rules_defining_actions"/> for details) that will be performed if the
      expression is true. </para>
    <para>The expression is built from operators, user-defined static values and and <emphasis
        role="bold">source fields</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="program_dules_adding_source_fields"
      /> for details). The source fields represent attribute and data element values which will be
      evaluated as part of the expression. </para>

    <para> Source fields represent a uniform way to include data values and attribute values in
      expressions. The source fields is defined as needed when creating expressions . When creating
      your first expression, you will typically have to define one or more source fields first, as
      expressions usually contain at least one data element or attribute value to be meaningful. The
      source fields is shared between all rules in your program, and by creating several rules,
      these will share the same library of source fields. </para>
    <para> To add a source field, click the &quot;+ Add source field&quot; button under the source
      fields list. This will open the following dialog: </para>

                  program stage. Can be useful in rules where the same data element is used in
                  several program stages, and a rule needs to evaluate the newest data value from

                  collected once during an enrollment, and should be hidden in subsequent events.
                  Another use case is making rules for validating input where there is an expected
                  progression from one event to the next - a rule can evaluate wether the previous

    <title> Defining expressions </title>
    <para> Each program rule has a single expression that determines whether rules action should be
      triggered, if the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is true the program rule is
      in effect and the actions will be executed. If the expression is false, the program rule is no
      longer in effect and the actions will no longer be applied. </para>
    <para> As a simple example, an expression is defined below using a single user-define static
      value, source fields(see previous chapter) and/or operators. Expressions can be typed into the
      edit expression text box, but buttons are available for inserting operators and source fields
      at the cursors position. To insert source fields, click the source field name within the list
