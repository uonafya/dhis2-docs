      all available data dimensions in DHIS 2. A pivot table is a dynamic tool for data analysis
      which lets you summarize and arrange data according to its dimensions. Examples of data
      dimensions in DHIS 2 are:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>data dimension itself (for example data elements, indicators and events)</para>
        </listitem>

    <para>From these dimensions you can freely select dimension <emphasis role="italic"

      you place a data dimension on columns, the pivot table will display one column per dimension
      item. If you place multiple data dimensions on columns, the pivot table displays one column
      for all combinations of the items in the selected dimensions. When you place a data dimension
      on rows, the pivot table displays one row per dimension item in a similar fashion. The
      dimensions you select as filters will not be included in the pivot table, but will aggregate
      and filter the table data based on the selected filter items.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Selecting dimension items</title>
      <para>The left menu will list sections for all available data dimensions. From each section
        you can select any number of dimension items. As an example, you can open the section for
        data elements and select any number of data elements from the available list. You can select
        an item by marking it and clicking on the arrow in the section header or simply
        double-clicking on the item. Before you can use a data dimension in your pivot table you
        must at least select one dimension item. If you arrange a dimension as columns or rows but
        do not select any dimension items, the dimension will be ignored.</para>
      <para>At least one member of the data dimension is required for all pivot tables. Available
        types include the following:</para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Indicators</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Data elements</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Reporting rates</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Event data items</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Program indicators</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>These dimensions can be combined together, so that you can display for instance
        aggregate data with reporting rates, or event data items together with program indicators,
        all in the same pivot tables. For the &quot;data element&quot; data dimension, you are also
        able to select &quot;Totals&quot; and &quot;Details&quot;, which will allow you to view
        different category combination options together on the same pivot table. </para>
      <para>For the period dimension you can choose between using fixed periods or relative periods.
        An example of a fixed period is &quot;January 2012&quot;. To select fixed periods start by
        selecting a period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from the list
        of available periods. </para>
      <para>Relative periods are periods relative to the current date. Examples of relative periods
        are &quot;Last month&quot;, &quot;Last 12 months&quot;, &quot;Last 5 years&quot;. Relative
        periods can be selected by ticking the check-boxes next to each period. The main advantage
        of using relative periods is that when you save a pivot table favorite, it will stay updated
        with the latest data as time goes by without the need for constantly updating it.</para>
      <para>For the organisation unit dimension you can select any number of organisation units from
        the hierarchy. To select all organisation units below a specific parent organisation unit,
        right click and click &quot;Select all children&quot;. To manually select multiple
        organisation units, click and hold the Ctrl button while clicking on organisation units. You
        can tick &quot;User org unit&quot;, &quot;User sub-units&quot; or &quot;User
        sub-x2-units&quot; in order to dynamically insert the organisation unit or units associated
        with your user account. This is useful when you save a pivot table favorite and want to
        share it with other users, as the organisation units linked with the other user&apos;s
        account will be used when viewing the favorite.</para>

      <para>Dynamic dimensions can consist of organisation unit group sets, data element group sets,
        or category option group sets which have been configured with the type of of
        &quot;Disaggregation&quot;. Once the group sets have been configured, they will be come
        available in the pivot tables, and can be used as additional analysis dimensions, for
        instance to analyze aggregate data by Type of organisational unit or Implementing partner.
        Dynamic dimensions work the same as fixed dimensions. </para>
      <tip>
        <para>Some dynamic dimensions may contain many members. This can cause issues with certain
          browsers due to the length of the URL when many dimension members are selected. A special
          &quot;All&quot; checkbox is available for dynamic dimensions, which allows you to include
          all available dimensions implicitly in your pivot table, without specifying each and every
          dimension member.</para>

      <title>Modifying pivot table layout</title>
      <para>After selecting data dimensions it is time to arrange your pivot table. Click
        &quot;Layout&quot; in the top menu to open the layout screen. In this screen you can
        position your data dimensions as table columns, rows or filters by clicking and dragging the
        dimensions from the dimensions list to the respective column, row and filter lists. You can
        set any number of dimensions in any of the lists. For instance, you can click on
        &quot;Organisation units&quot; and drag it to the row list in order to position the
        organisation unit dimension as table rows. Note that indicators, data elements and data set
        reporting rates are part of the common &quot;Data&quot; dimension and will be displayed
        together in the pivot table. For instance, after selecting indicators and data elements in
        the left menu, you can drag &quot;Organisation Unit&quot; from the available dimensions list
        to the row dimension list in order to arrange them as rows in the pivot table.</para>

        effect. Since we in our example have selected both the period and organisation unit
        dimension as rows, the pivot table will generate all combinations of the items in these
        dimensions and produce a table like this:</para>

    <title>Managing favorites</title>
    <para>When you have created a pivot table it is convenient to save it as a favorite. To do so,
      click &quot;Favorites&quot; on the top menu, click &quot;Add new&quot;, give the favorite a
      descriptive name and click &quot;Create&quot;. You can search for favorites through the search

    <title>Downloading data from a pivot table</title>
    <para>You can download the data in the current pivot table by clicking on &quot;Download&quot;
      in the top menu. The data can be downloaded in various formats including Microsoft Excel, CSV,
      HTML. The data table will have one column per dimension and contain names of the dimension
      items. You can easily create a pivot table in Microsoft Excel from the downloaded Excel file
      by clicking on &quot;pivot table&quot; in the top panel, then clicking on &quot;create pivot
      table&quot;, then marking the data range in the spreadsheet before clicking &quot;OK&quot;.u
      can </para>
    <para>Data can also be downloaded in JSON, XML, Excel, and CSV as plain data formats with
      different identification schemes (ID, Code, and Name). The data document will use identifiers
      of the dimension items and will be opened in a new browser window in order to reveal the URL
      of the request to the Web API in the address bar. This will be useful for developers of apps
      and other client modules based on the DHIS 2 Web API or for those who require a plan data
      source, for instance for import into statistical packages.</para>
    <para>For advanced users, two additional options are available under &quot;Advanced&quot;. JXRML
      will produce a template of a Jasper Report which can be further customized based on your exact
      needs and used as the basis for a standard report in DHIS2. The &quot;Raw data SQL&quot; will
      provide the actual SQL statement used to generate the pivot table. This could then be used as
      a data source in a Jasper report, or as the basis for an SQL view. </para>
    <para>Lastly, the pivot table app allows you to download data in CSV format directly without
      first rendering the data in the Web Browser. This will help overcome any constraint in the
      system settings that has been set in regards to the maximum number of analytic records. This
      allows for much larger batches of data to be downloaded and used for later offline analysis.
      This can be done by clicking on the arrow beside the update button.</para>

          embedded in any web page by using a plugin. If you have created a table in the Pivot Table
          app you will get the plug-in configuration for this table by clicking the
          &quot;Share&quot; button the tool bar and then &quot;Embed as webpage&quot;. You will find

    <title>Analysis integration/Displaying pivot table as a chart??</title>
    <para>The analysis apps in DHIS 2 are completely integrated, so you can easily switch
   between pivot table, chart and map visualization of your data. When you have made a pivot table
   you can click e.g. &quot;Chart&quot; in the top right corner and then select &quot;Open this table as chart&quot;.</para>

    <para>If you just want to visualize a small part of your pivot table as a chart, you can click directly on a
    value in the table instead. A menu will appear. If you mouse hover the &quot;Open selection as chart&quot; option you can see
    that some of the dimension headers in the table are highlighted, indicating what data will be visualized as a chart.</para>

    <title>Constraints and tips/Tips and tricks ??</title>
    <para>When selecting and arranging dimensions there are a few constraints that apply. All of
      these constraints are validated and the pivot table module will provide feedback if any
      constraint is violated.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>At least one dimension must be selected on columns or rows.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>At least one period must be included in the pivot table.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data element group sets and reporting rates cannot appear in the same pivot
          table.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A table cannot contain more than the maximum number of analytics records which have been specified through the system settings. The maximum number of records could also be constrained by the maximum RAM which is available to your browser. Considering making more smaller tables, instead of one table which displays all of your data elements and indicators together.  </para>

    <tip>
      <para>Pivot tables in DHIS2 are limited to a system set paramater, which controls the number of data values which can be returned. The reason for this is two fold. First, it would be easy to overwhelm the server with a very complicated request for a large pivot table. Second, the amount of data which is able to be rendered in a browser is fairly limited. If you are having problems with very large or complex tables, consider to try and reduce the number of items. It is usually more useful to have smaller, concise tables which are easier to understand and which address a particular analysis. </para>
