  <title>Installation</title>
  <para>The installation chapter provides information on how to install DHIS 2 in various contexts, including online central server, offline local network, standalone application and self-contained package called DHIS 2 Live.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
  
  <para>DHIS 2 runs on all platforms for which there exists a Java Runtime Environment version 8 or
      higher, which includes most popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux and Mac. DHIS 2
      also runs on many relational database systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2 and Derby. DHIS 2
      is packaged as a standard Java Web Archive (WAR-file) and thus runs on any Servlet containers
      such as Tomcat and Jetty.</para>
  <para>The DHIS 2 team recommends Ubuntu 14.04 LTS operating system, PostgreSQL database system and
      Tomcat Servlet container as the preferred environment for server installations.</para>
  <para>This chapter provides a guide for setting up the above technology stack. It should however be read as a guide for getting up and running and not as an exhaustive documentation for the mentioned environment. We refer to the official Ubuntu, PostgreSQL and Tomcat documentation for in-depth reading.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Server specifications</title>
    <para>DHIS 2 is a database intensive application and requires that your server has an
      appropriate amount of RAM, number of CPU cores and a fast disk. These recommendations should
      be considered as rules-of-thumb and not exact measures. DHIS 2 scales linearly on the amount
      of RAM and number of CPU cores so the more you can afford, the better the application will
      perform.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>RAM: At least 1 GB memory per 1 million captured data records per month or per 1000
          concurrent users. At least 4 GB for a small instance, 12 GB for a medium instance.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>CPU cores: 4 CPU cores for a small instance, 8 CPU cores for a medium or large
          instance.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Disk: Ideally use an SSD. Otherwise use a 7200 rpm disk. Minimum read speed is 150
          Mb/s, 200 Mb/s is good, 350 Mb/s or better is ideal. </para>

    <title>Server setup</title>
    <para>This section describes how to set up a server instance of DHIS 2 on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit
      with PostgreSQL as database system and Tomcat as Servlet container. This guide is not meant to
      be a step-by-step guide per se, but rather to serve as a reference to how DHIS 2 can be
      deployed on a server. There are many possible deployment strategies, which will differ
      depending on the operating system and database you are using, and other factors. The term
        <emphasis role="italic">invoke</emphasis> refers to executing a given command in a terminal. </para>
    <para>For a national server the recommended configuration is a quad-core 2 Ghz processor or
      higher and 12 Gb RAM or higher. Note that a 64 bit operating system is required for utilizing
      more than 4 Gb of RAM. </para>
    <para>For this guide we assume that 8 Gb RAM is allocated for PostgreSQL and 8 GB RAM is
      allocated for Tomcat/JVM, and that a 64-bit operating system is used. <emphasis role="italic">If you are running a different configuration please adjust the suggested values accordingly!</emphasis> We recommend that the available memory is split roughly equally
      between the database and the JVM. Remember to leave some of the physical memory to the
      operating system for it to perform its tasks, for instance around 2 GB. The steps marked as
        <emphasis role="italic">optional</emphasis>, like the step for performance tuning, can be
      done at a later stage.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Creating a user to run DHIS 2</title>
      <para>You should create a dedicated user for running DHIS - it is not recommended to run as
        the root user. Create a new user called dhis by invoking:</para>
      <screen>useradd -d /home/dhis -m dhis -s /bin/bash</screen>
      <para>Then make the user able to perform operations temporarily as root user by
        invoking:</para>
      <screen>usermod -G sudo dhis</screen>
      <para>Then to set the password for your account invoke:</para>
      <screen>passwd dhis</screen>
      <para>Make sure you set a strong password with at least 15 random characters. You might want
        to disable remote login for the root account for improved security by invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo passwd -l root</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Setting server time zone and locale (optional)</title>
      <para>It may be necessary to reconfigure the time zone of the server to match the time zone of
        the location which the DHIS 2 server will be covering. If you are using a virtual private
        server, the default time zone may not correspond to the time zone of your DHIS 2 location.
        You can easily reconfigure the time zone by invoking the below and following the
        instructions.</para>
      <screen>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</screen>
      <para>PostgreSQL is sensitive to locales so you might have to install your locale first. To
        check existing locales and install new ones (e.g. Norwegian):</para>
      <screen>locale -a
sudo locale-gen nb_NO.UTF-8</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>PostgreSQL installation</title>
      <para>Install PostgreSQL 9.3 by invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3</screen>
      <para>Switch to the postgres user by invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo su postgres</screen>
      <para>Create a non-privileged user called <emphasis role="italic">dhis</emphasis> by
        invoking:</para>
      <screen>createuser -SDRP dhis</screen>
      <para>Enter a secure password at the prompt. Create a database by invoking:</para>
      <screen>createdb -O dhis dhis2</screen>
      <para>Return to your session by invoking <code>exit</code> You now have a PostgreSQL user
        called <emphasis role="italic">dhis</emphasis> and a database called <emphasis role="italic"
          >dhis2</emphasis>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>PostgreSQL performance tuning</title>
      <para>Tuning PostgreSQL is necessary to achieve a high-performing system but is optional in
        terms of getting DHIS 2 to run. PostgreSQL is configured and tuned through the <emphasis
          role="italic">postgresql.conf</emphasis> file which can be edited like this:</para>
      <para><screen>sudo nano /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/postgresql.conf</screen></para>
      <para>and set the following properties:</para>
      <para>
        <screen>max_connections = 200</screen>
      </para>
      <para>Determines maximum number of connections which PostgreSQL will allow.</para>
      <para><screen>shared_buffers = 3200MB</screen></para>
      <para>Determines how much memory should be allocated exclusively for PostgreSQL caching. This
      setting controls the size of the kernel shared memory which should be reserved for PostgreSQL.
      Should be set to around 40% of total memory dedicated for PostgreSQL.</para>
      <para><screen>work_mem = 20MB</screen></para>
      <para>Determines the amount of memory used for internal sort and hash operations. This setting
      is per connection, per query so a lot of memory may be consumed if raising this too high.
      Setting this value correctly is essential for DHIS 2 aggregation performance.</para>
      <para><screen>maintenance_work_mem = 512MB</screen></para>
      <para>Determines the amount of memory PostgreSQL can use for maintenance operations such as
        creating indexes, running vacuum, adding foreign keys. Incresing this value might improve
        performance of index creation during the analytics generation processes.</para>
      <para><screen>effective_cache_size = 8000MB</screen></para>
      <para>An estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system (not
      an allocation) and is used by PostgreSQL to determine whether a query plan will fit into
      memory or not. Setting it to a higher value than what is really available will result in poor
      performance. This value should be inclusive of the shared_buffers setting. PostgreSQL has two
      layers of caching: The first layer uses the kernel shared memory and is controlled by the
      shared_buffers setting. PostgreSQL delegates the second layer to the operating system disk
      cache and the size of available memory can be given with the effective_cache_size
      setting.</para>
      <para><screen>checkpoint_segments = 32</screen></para>
      <para>PostgreSQL writes new transactions to a log file called WAL segments which are 16MB in size. When a number of segments have been written a checkpoint occurs. Setting this number to a larger value will thus improve performance for write-heavy systems such as DHIS 2.</para>
      <para><screen>checkpoint_completion_target = 0.8</screen></para>
      <para>Determines the percentage of segment completion before a checkpoint occurs. Setting this to a high value will thus spread the writes out and lower the average write overhead.</para>
      <para><screen>wal_buffers = 16MB</screen></para>
      <para>Sets the memory used for buffering during the WAL write process. Increasing this value might improve throughput in write-heavy systems.</para>
      <para><screen>synchronous_commit = off</screen></para>
      <para>Specifies whether transaction commits will wait for WAL records to be written to the disk before returning to the client or not. Setting this to off will improve performance considerably. It also implies that there is a slight delay between the transaction is reported successful to the client and it actually being safe, but the database state cannot be corrupted and this is a good alternative for performance-intensive and write-heavy systems like DHIS 2.</para>
      <para><screen>wal_writer_delay = 10000ms</screen></para>
      <para>Specifies the delay between WAL write operations. Setting this to a high value will improve performance on write-heavy systems since potentially many write operations can be executed within a single flush to disk.</para>
      <para>Restart PostgreSQL by invoking <code>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart</code></para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Database configuration</title>
      <para>The database connection information is provided to DHIS 2 through a configuration file
        called <emphasis role="italic">dhis.conf</emphasis>. Create this file and save it in a
        convenient location. A configuration file for PostgreSQL corresponding to the above setup
        has these properties: </para>
      <para><screen># Hibernate SQL dialect
connection.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# JDBC driver class
connection.driver_class = org.postgresql.Driver

# JDBC driver connection URL
connection.url = jdbc:postgresql:dhis2

# Database username
connection.username = dhis

# Database password
connection.password = xxxx

# Database schema behavior, can be validate, update, create, create-drop
connection.schema = update

# Encryption password (sensitive)
encryption.password = xxxx</screen></para>
      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">encryption.password</emphasis> property is the password used
        when encrypting and decrypting data in the database. Note that the password must not be
        changed once it has been set and data has been encrypted as the data can then no longer be
        decrypted. Remember to set a strong password of at least <emphasis role="bold">24
          characters</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>A common mistake is to have a white-space after the last property value so make sure
        there is no white-space at the end of any line. Also remember that this file contains the
        clear text password for your DHIS 2 database so it needs to be protected from unauthorized
        access. To do this invoke the following command which ensures that only the dhis user which
        owns the file is allowed to read it:</para>
      <screen>chmod 0600 dhis.conf</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>File store configuration (optional)</title>
      <para>DHIS 2 is capable of capturing and storing files. By default files will be stored on the
        file system of the server which runs DHIS 2 in a <emphasis role="italic">files</emphasis>
        directory under the <emphasis role="italic">DHIS2_HOME</emphasis> external directory
        location.</para>
      <para>You can also configure DHIS 2 to store files on cloud-based storage providers.
        Currently, AWS S3 is the only supported provider. To enable cloud-based storage you must
        define the following addtional properties in your <emphasis role="italic"
          >dhis.conf</emphasis> file:</para>
      <screen># File store provider. Currently 'filesystem' and 'aws-s3' are supported
filestore.provider = filesystem

# Directory / bucket name, refers to folder within external directory on file system and 'bucket' on AWS S3
filestore.container = files

# The following configuration is applicable only on non-filesystem providers (AWS S3)

# Datacenter location. Not required but recommended for performance reasons.
filestore.location = eu-west-1

# Public identity / username
filestore.identity = xxxx

# Secret password (sensitive)
filestore.secret = xxxx</screen>
      <para>This configuration is an example reflecting the defaults and should be changed to fit
        your needs. In other words, you can omit it entirely if you plan to use the default values.
        If you want to use an external provider the last block of properties need to be defined, as
        well as the <emphasis role="italic">provider</emphasis> property being set to a supported
        provider (currently only AWS S3).</para>
      <para>For a production system the initial setup of the file store should be carefully
        considered as moving files across storage providers while keeping the integrity of the
        database references could be complex. Keep in mind that the contents of the file store might
        contain both sensitive and integral information and protecting access to the folder as well
        as making sure a backup plan is in place is recommended on a production
        implementation.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">A note on external provider support: AWS S3 is the only
          supported provider at the moment but more providers are likely to be added, such as Google
          Cloud Store and Rackspace Cloud Files. Let the developers know if you have inquiries about
          adding support for more providers.</emphasis></para>

      <title>Java installation</title>
      <para>Oracle Java 8 JDK is the recommended Java option as it provides the greates operating
        system support, including Ubuntu LTS 14.04. The webupd8team Java PPA provides the necessary
        packages.</para>
      <screen>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer</screen>
      <para>Check that your installation is okay by invoking:</para>
      <screen>java -version</screen>
      <para>You can also ensure that the appropriate environment variables are set by installing this
        package:</para>
      <screen>sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Install Tomcat and DHIS 2</title>
      <para>To install the Tomcat servlet container we will utilize the Tomcat user package by
        invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo apt-get install tomcat7-user</screen>
      <para>This package lets us easily create a new Tomcat instance. The instance will be created
        in the current directory. An appropriate location is the home directory of the dhis
        user:</para>
      <screen>tomcat7-instance-create tomcat-dhis</screen>
      <para>This will create an instance in a directory called <emphasis role="italic"
          >tomcat-dhis</emphasis>. Note that the tomcat7-user package allows for creating any number
        of dhis instances if that is desired.</para>
      <para>Next edit the file <emphasis role="italic">tomcat-dhis/bin/setenv.sh</emphasis> and add
        the lines below. The first line will set the location of your Java Runtime Environment, the
        second will dedicate memory to Tomcat and the third will set the location for where DHIS 2
        will search for the <emphasis role="italic">dhis.conf</emphasis> configuration file. Please
        check that the path the Java binaries are correct as they might vary from system to system,
        e.g. on AMD systems you might see <emphasis role="italic">/java-7-openjdk-amd64</emphasis>
        Note that you should adjust this to your environment:</para>
      <para><screen>export JAVA_HOME=&apos;/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/&apos;
export JAVA_OPTS=&apos;-Xmx7500m -Xms4000m&apos;
export DHIS2_HOME=&apos;/home/dhis/config&apos;</screen></para>
      <para>The Tomcat configiration file is located in <emphasis role="italic"
          >tomcat-dhis/conf/server.xml</emphasis>. The element which defines the connection to DHIS
        is the <emphasis role="italic">Connector</emphasis> element with port 8080. You can change
        the port number in the Connector element to a desired port if necessary. If UTF-8 encoding
        of request data is needed, make sure that the <emphasis role="italic">URIEncoding</emphasis>
        attribute is set to <emphasis role="italic">UTF-8</emphasis>.</para>
      <screen>&lt;Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
  connectionTimeout="20000"
  redirectPort="8443"
  URIEncoding="UTF-8" /></screen>
      <para>The next step is to download the DHIS 2 WAR file and place it into the webapps directory
        of Tomcat. You can download the DHIS version 2.15 WAR release like this (replace 2.15 with
        your preferred version if necessary):</para>
      <screen>wget https://www.dhis2.org/download/releases/2.21/dhis.war</screen>
      <para>Move the WAR file into the Tomcat webapps directory. We want to call the WAR file
        ROOT.war in order to make it available at localhost directly without a context path:</para>
      <screen>mv dhis.war tomcat-dhis/webapps/ROOT.war</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Running DHIS 2</title>
      <para>DHIS 2 can now be started by invoking:</para>
      <screen>tomcat-dhis/bin/startup.sh</screen>
      <para>DHIS 2 can be stopped by invoking:</para>
      <screen>tomcat-dhis/bin/shutdown.sh</screen>
      <para>To monitor the behavior of Tomcat the log is the primary source of information. The log
        can be viewed with the following command:</para>
      <screen>tail -f tomcat-dhis/logs/catalina.out</screen>
      <para>Assuming that the WAR file is called ROOT.war, you can now access your DHIS instance at
        the following URL:</para>
      <screen>http://localhost:8080</screen>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Reverse proxy configuration</title>
    <para>A reverse proxy is a proxy server that acts on behalf of a server. Using a reverse proxy in combination with a servlet container is optional but has many advantages:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Requests can be mapped and passed on to multiple servlet containers - this improves flexibility and makes it easier to run multiple instances of DHIS on the same server. It also makes it possible to change the internal server setup without affecting clients.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The DHIS application can be run as a non-root user on a port different than 80 which reduces the consequences of session hijacking.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The reverse proxy can  act as a single SSL server and be configured to inspect requests for malicious content, log requests and responses and provide non-sensitive error messages which will improve security.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <section>
      <title>Basic setup for nginx</title>
      <para>We recommend using <ulink url="http://www.nginx.org">nginx</ulink>  as reverse proxy due to its low memory
        footprint and ease of use. To install invoke the following:</para>
      <screen>sudo apt-get install nginx</screen>
      <para>nginx can now be started, reloaded and stopped with the following commands:</para>
      <para><screen>sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop</screen></para>
      <para>Now that we have installed nginx we will now continue to configure regular proxying of
        requests to our Tomcat instance, which we assume runs at <emphasis role="italic"
          >http://localhost:8080</emphasis>. To configure nginx you can open the configuration file
        by invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf</screen>
      <para>nginx configuration is built around a hierarchy of blocks representing http, server and
        location, where each block inherit settings from parent blocks. The following snippet will
        configure nginx to proxy pass (redirect) requests from port 80 (which is the port nginx will
        listen on by default) to our Tomcat instance. Include the following configuration in
        nginx.conf:</para>
      <para><screen>http {
  gzip on; # Enables compression, incl Web API content-types
  gzip_types
    "application/json;charset=utf-8" application/json
    "application/javascript;charset=utf-8" application/javascript text/javascript
    "application/xml;charset=utf-8" application/xml text/xml
    "text/css;charset=utf-8" text/css
    "text/plain;charset=utf-8" text/plain;

  server {
    listen               80;
    root  /home/dhis/tomcat/webapps/ROOT; # Update path!
    client_max_body_size 10M;

    # Serve static files

    location ~ (\.js|\.css|\.gif|\.woff|\.ttf|\.eot|\.ico|(/dhis-web-commons/|/images/|/icons/).*\.png)$ {
      add_header  Cache-Control public;
      expires     14d;
    }

    # Proxy pass to servlet container

    location / {
      proxy_pass                http://localhost:8080/;
      proxy_redirect            off;
      proxy_set_header          Host               $host;
      proxy_set_header          X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-Proto  http;
      proxy_buffer_size         128k;
      proxy_buffers             8 128k;
      proxy_busy_buffers_size   256k;
    }
  }
}</screen></para>
      <para>You can now access your DHIS instance at <emphasis role="italic">http://localhost</emphasis>. Since the reverse proxy has been set up we can improve
        security by making Tomcat only listen for local connections. In <emphasis role="italic">/conf/server.xml</emphasis> you can add an <emphasis role="italic">address</emphasis>
        attribute with the value <emphasis role="italic">localhost</emphasis> to the Connector
        element for HTTP 1.1 like this:</para>
      <para><screen>&lt;Connector address=&quot;localhost&quot; protocol=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; ... &gt;</screen></para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Enabling SSL on nginx</title>
      <para>In order to improve security it is recommended to configure the server running DHIS to
        communicate with clients over an encrypted connection and to identify itself to clients
        using a trusted certificate. This can be achieved through SSL which is an cryptographic
        communication protocol running on top of TCP/IP. First, install the required <emphasis role="italic">openssl</emphasis> library:</para>
      <screen>sudo apt-get install openssl</screen>
      <para>To configure nginx to use SSL you will need a proper SSL certificate from an SSL provider. The cost of a certificate varies a lot depending on encryption strength. An affordable certificate from <ulink url="http://www.rapidsslonline.com">Rapid SSL Online</ulink> should serve most purposes. To generate the CSR (certificate signing request) you can invoke the  command below.

      <screen>openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr</screen>
      <para>When you have received your certificate files (.pem or .crt) you will need to place it
        together with the generated server.key file in a location which is reachable by nginx. A
        good location for this can be the same directory as where your nginx.conf file is
        located.</para>
      <para>Below is an nginx server block where the certificate files are named server.crt and server.key. Since SSL connections usually occur on port 443 (HTTPS) we pass requests on that port (443) on to the DHIS instance running on <emphasis role="italic">http://localhost:8080</emphasis> The first server block will rewrite all requests connecting to port 80 and force the use of HTTPS/SSL. This is also necessary because DHIS is using a lot of redirects internally which must be passed on to use HTTPS. Remember to replace <emphasis role="italic">&lt;server-ip&gt;</emphasis> with the  IP of your server. These blocks should replace the  one from the previous section.</para>

      <title>Enabling caching and SSL on nginx</title>
      <para>Requests for reports, charts, maps and other analysis-related resources will often take
        some time to respond and might utilize a lot of server resources. In order to improve
        response times, reduce the load on the server and hide potential server downtime we can
        introduce a cache proxy in our server setup. The cached content will be stored in directory
        /var/cache/nginx, and up to 250 MB of storage will be allocated. Nginx will create this
        directory automatically.</para>

      <title>Starting tomcat on boot-time</title>
      <para>In certain situations a server might reboot unexpectedly. It is hence preferable to have
        Tomcat start automatically when the server starts. To achieve that the first step is to
        create init scripts. Create a new file called <code>tomcat</code> and paste the below
        content into it (adjust the HOME variable to your environment):</para>
      <screen>#!/bin/sh
#Tomcat init script

HOME=/home/dhis/tomcat/bin

case $1 in
start)
        sh ${HOME}/startup.sh

stop)
        sh ${HOME}/shutdown.sh
        ;;
restart)
        sh ${HOME}/shutdown.sh
        sleep 5
        sh ${HOME}/startup.sh
        ;;
esac
exit 0</screen>
      <para>Move the script to the init script directory and make them executable by
        invoking:</para>
      <screen>sudo mv tomcat /etc/init.d
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/tomcat</screen>
      <para>Next make sure the tomcat init script will be invoked during system startup and
        shutdown:</para>
      <screen>sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f tomcat defaults 81</screen>
      <para>Tomcat will now be started at system startup and stopped at system shutdown. If you
        later need to revert this you can replace <code>defaults</code> with <code>remove</code> and
        invoke the above commands again.</para>

      <title>Making resources available with nginx</title>
      <para>In some scenarios it is desirable to make certain resources publicly available on the Web without requiring authentication. One example is when you want to make data analysis related resources in the Web API available in a Web portal. The following example will allow access to charts, maps, reports, report table and document resources through basic authentication by injecting an <emphasis role="italic">Authorization</emphasis> HTTP  header into the request. It will remove the Cookie header from the request and the Set-Cookie header from the response in order to avoid changing the currently logged in user. It is recommended to create a user for this purpose given only the minimum authorities required. The Authorization value can be constructed by Base64-encoding the username appended with a colon and the password and prefix it &quot;Basic &quot;, more precisely &quot;Basic base64_encode(username:password)&quot;. It will check the HTTP method used for requests and return <emphasis role="italic">405 Method Not Allowed</emphasis> if anything but GET is detected.</para>
      <para>It can be favorable to set up a separate domain for such public users when using this approach. This is because we don&apos;t want to change the credentials for already logged in users when they access the public resources. For instance, when your server is deployed at somedomain.com, you can set a dedicated subdomain at api.somedomain.com, and point URLs from your portal to this subdomain.</para>
      <screen>server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  api.somedomain.com;
    
  location ~ ^/(api/(charts|chartValues|reports|reportTables|documents|maps|organisationUnits)|dhis-web-commons/javascripts|images|dhis-web-commons-ajax-json|dhis-web-mapping|dhis-web-visualizer) {
    if ($request_method != GET) {
      return 405;
    }

      <title>App setup with nginx</title>
      <para>DHIS 2 supports installation of apps. To avoid having to re-install your apps every time
        you update and replace the DHIS 2 WAR file it is beneficial to deploy apps on the server
        file system outside the DHIS 2 webapp directory. To install apps directly in nginx you can
        follow these steps. First create a directory which will be used as the app installation
        folder.</para>
      <screen>sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/apps</screen>
      <para>Make sure that the directory is owned by the user which runs Tomcat in order to allow
        the Tomcat process to save apps to this directory when they are uploaded. If the user
        running Tomcat is <emphasis role="italic">dhis</emphasis> you can use the below
        command.</para>
      <screen>sudo chown dhis:dhis /usr/share/nginx/apps</screen>
      <para>You must add an <emphasis role="italic">apps</emphasis> location in the nginx.conf
        configuration file like below. Note that we omit the apps directory itself in the root
        directive. </para>
      <screen>server {
  ...
  location /apps/ {
    root      /usr/share/nginx;
    expires   max;
  }
  ...
}  </screen>
      <para>Finally navigate to the app configuration screen in your DHIS 2 instance by going to App
        management > Settings and adjust the settings accordingly.</para>
      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">app installation folder</emphasis> should point to the base
        directory path on the server file system:</para>
      <screen>/usr/share/nginx/apps</screen>
      <para>The <emphasis role="italic">app base URL</emphasis> should point to the URL where DHIS 2
        can find the apps. Replace www.domain.com with your real domain name and according to how
        you have deployed DHIS 2.</para>
      <screen>http://www.domain.com/apps</screen>
      <para>You should now be ready to upload apps from the App management screen. Remember to
        reload the nginx configuration. </para>

      <title>Basic reverse proxy setup with Apache</title>
      <para>The Apache HTTP server is the most common </para>
      <important>
        <para>Using nginx is the preferred option as reverse proxy with DHIS 2 and you should not
          attempt to install both nginx and Apache on the same server. If you have installed nginx
          please ignore this section. </para>
      </important>
      <para>The Apache HTTP server is the most widely used HTTP server currently. Depdenign on your
        exact nature of deployment, you may need to use Apache as a reverse proxy for your DHIS 2
        server. In this section, we will describe how to implement a simple reverse proxy setup with
        Apache. </para>
      <para>First we need to install a few necessary programs modules for Apache and enable the modules. </para>
      <para><screen>sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-proxy-html libapache2-mod-jk
a2enmod proxy proxy_ajp proxy_connect</screen></para>
      <para>Lets define an AJP connector which Apache HTTP server will use to connect to Tomcat with. The Tomcat <filename>server.xml</filename> file should be located in the /conf/ director of your Tomcat installation. Be sure this line is uncommented.You can set the port to anything you like which is unused.</para>
      <para><screen>&lt;Connector port=&quot;8009&quot; protocol=&quot;AJP/1.3&quot; redirectPort=&quot;8443&quot; /&gt;
</screen>Now, we need to make the adjustments to the Apache HTTP server which will answer requests on port 80 and pass them to the Tomcat server through an AJP connector. Edit the file <filename>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/proxy.conf</filename> so that it looks like the example below.  Be sure that the port defined in the configuration file matches the one from Tomcat.</para>
      <para><screen>&lt;IfModule mod_proxy.c&gt;

ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /dhis  ajp://localhost:8009/dhis
ProxyPassReverse /dhis  ajp://localhost:8009/dhis

&lt;Location &quot;/dhis&quot;&gt;
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
&lt;/Location&gt;     
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</screen></para>
      <para>You now can restart Tomcat and the Apache HTTPD server and your DHIS 2 instance should be available on http://<emphasis>myserver</emphasis>/dhis where <emphasis>myserver</emphasis> is the hostname of your server. </para>

      <title>SSL encryption with Apache</title>
      <para>Using Apache and the reverse proxy  setup described in the previous section, we can easily implement encrypted transfer of data between clients and the server over HTTPS. This section will describe how to use self-signed certificates, although  the same procedure could be used if you have fully-signed certificates as well. </para>
      <para>First (as root), generate the necessary private key files and CSR (Certificate Signing Request) </para>
      <screen>mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
cd /etc/apache2/ssl
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</screen>
      <para>We need to remove the password from the key, otherwise Apache will not be able to use it. </para>
      <para><screen>cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</screen></para>
      <para>Next, generate a self-signed certificate which will be valid for one year.</para>
      <screen>openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey \ server.key -out server.crt</screen>
      <para>Now, lets configure Apache by enabling the SSL modules and creating a default site.</para>
      <screen>a2enmod ssl
a2ensite default-ssl</screen>
      <para>Now, we need to edit the default-ssl (located at <filename>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl</filename>) file in order to enable the SSL transfer functionality of Apache. </para>
      <para><screen>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
        ServerAdmin wemaster@mydomain.org
       SSLEngine On
       SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key
...</screen></para>
      <para>Be sure that the *:80 section of this file is changed to port *:443, which is the default SSL port. Also, be sure to change the ServerAdmin to the webmaster&apos;s email. Lastly, we need to be sure that the hostname is setup properly in /etc/hosts. Just under the &quot;localhost&quot; line, be sure to add the server&apos;s IP address and domain name. </para>
      <para><screen>127.0.0.1 localhost
XXX.XX.XXX.XXX foo.mydomain.org</screen></para>
      <para>Now, just restart Apache and you should be able to view https://foo.mydomain.org/dhis. </para>

    <title>LDAP configuration</title>
    <para>DHIS 2 is capable of using an LDAP server for authentication of users. For LDAP
      authentication it is required to have a matching user in the DHIS 2 database per LDAP entry.
      The DHIS 2 user will be used to represent authorities / user roles. </para>
    <para>To set up LDAP authentication you need to configure the LDAP server URL, a manager user
      and an LDAP search base and search filter. This configuration should be done in the main DHIS
      2 configuration file (dhis.conf). LDAP users, or entries, are identified by distinguished
      names (DN from now on). An example configuration looks like this:</para>
    <screen># LDAP server URL
ldap.url = ldaps://domain.org:636

# LDAP manager entry distinguished name
ldap.manager.dn = cn=johndoe,dc=domain,dc=org

# LDAP manager entry password
ldap.manager.password = xxxx

# LDAP base search
ldap.search.base = dc=domain,dc=org

# LDAP search filter
ldap.search.filter = (cn={0})</screen>
    <para>The LDAP configuration properties are explained below:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">ldap.url:</emphasis> The URL of the LDAP server for which to
            authenticate against. Using SSL/encryption is strongly recommended in order to make
            authentication secure. As example URL is <emphasis role="italic"
              >ldaps://domain.org:636</emphasis>, where ldaps refers to the protocol, <emphasis
              role="italic">domain.org</emphasis> refers to the domain name or IP address, and
              <emphasis role="italic">636</emphasis> refers to the port (636 is default for

            to the DN of that entry. I.e. this is not the user which will be authenticated when
            logging into DHIS 2, rather the user which binds to the LDAP server in order to do the
            authentication.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">ldap.manager.password:</emphasis> The password for the LDAP
            manager user.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">ldap.search.base:</emphasis> The search base, or the
            distinguished name of the search base object, which defines the location in the
            directory from which the LDAP search begins.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="italic">ldap.search.filter:</emphasis> The filter for matching DNs
            of entries in the LDAP directory. The {0} variable will be substituted by the DHIS 2

            username.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>DHIS 2 will use the supplied username / password and try to authenticate against an LDAP
      server entry, then look up user roles / authorities from a corresponding DHIS 2 user. This
      implies that a user must have a matching entry in the LDAP directory as well as a DHIS 2 user
      in order to log in.</para>
    <para>During authentication, DHIS 2 will try to bind to the LDAP server using the configured
      LDAP server URL and the manager DN and password. Once the binding is done, it will search for
      an entry in the directory using the configured LDAP search base and search filter.</para>
    <para>The {0} variable in the configured filter will be substituted beforing applying the
      filter. By default, it will be substituted by the supplied username. You can also set a custom
      LDAP identifier on the relevant DHIS 2 user account. This can be done throught the DHIS 2 user
      module user interface in the add or edit screen by setting the "LDAP identifier" property.
      When set, the LDAP identifier will be subsituted for the {0} variable in the filter. This
      feature is useful when the LDAP common name is not suitable or cannot for some reason be used
      as a DHIS 2 username.</para>

    <title>Application logging</title>
    <para>The DHIS 2 application log output is directed to multiple files and locations. First, log
      output is sent to standard output. The Tomcat servlet container usually outputs standard
      output to a file under "logs":<screen>&lt;tomcat-dir>/logs/catalina.out</screen></para>
    <para>Second, log output is written to a "logs" directory under the DHIS 2 home directory as
      defined by the the DHIS2_HOME environment variables. There is a main log file for all output,
      and separate log files for various background processes. The main file includes the background
      process logs as well. The log files are capped at 50 Mb and log content is continuously
      appended.<screen>&lt;DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis.log

&lt;DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis-analytics-table.log

&lt;DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis-data-exchange.log

&lt;DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis-data-sync.log</screen></para>
    <para>In order to override the default logging you can specify a Java system property with the
      name <emphasis role="italic">log4j.configuration</emphasis> and a value pointing to the Log4j
      configuration file on the classpath. If you want to point to a file on the file system (i.e.
      outside Tomcat) you can use the <emphasis role="italic">file</emphasis> prefix e.g. like
      this:<screen>-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/home/dhis/config/log4j.properties</screen></para>
    <para>Java system properties can be set e.g. through the <emphasis role="italic"
        >JAVA_OPTS</emphasis> environment variable.</para>
    <para>DHIS 2 will eventually phase out logging to standard out / catalina.out and as a result it
      is recommended to rely on the logs under DHIS2_HOME.</para>

    <title>Working with the PostgreSQL database</title>
    <para>Common operations when managing a DHIS instance are dumping and restoring databases. To
      make a dump (copy) of your database, assuming the setup from the installation section, you can
      invoke the following: </para>
    <screen>pg_dump dhis2 -U dhis -f dhis2.sql</screen>
    <para>The first argument (dhis2) refers to the name of the database. The second argument (dhis)
      refers to the database user. The last argument (dhis2.sql) is the file name of the copy. If
      you want to compress the file copy immediately you can do:</para>
    <screen>pg_dump dhis2 -U dhis | gzip &gt; dhis2.sql.gz</screen>
    <para>To restore this copy on another system, you first need to create an empty database as
      described in the installation section. You also need to gunzip the copy if you created a
      compressed version. You can the invoke:</para>
    <screen>psql -d dhis2 -U dhis -f dhis2.sql</screen>

    <title>DHIS 2 Live setup</title>
    <para>The DHIS 2 Live package is extremely convenient to install and run. It is intended for
      demonstrations, for users who want to explore the system and for small, offline installations
      typically at districts or facilities. It only requires a Java Runtime Environment and runs on
      all browsers except Internet Explorer 7 and lower.</para>
    <para>To install start by downloading DHIS 2 Live from <emphasis role="italic"
        >http://dhis2.org</emphasis> and extract the archive to any location. On Windows click the
      executable archive. On Linux invoke the startup.sh script. After the startup process is done
      your default web browser will automtically be pointed to <emphasis role="italic"
        >http://localhost:8082</emphasis> where the application is accessible. A system tray menu is
      accessible on most operating systems where you can start and stop the server and start new
      browser sesssions. Please note that if you have the server running there is no need to start
      it again, simply open the application from the tray menu.</para>
    <para>DHIS 2 Live is running on an embedded Jetty servlet container and an embedded H2 database.
      However it can easily be configured to run on other database systems such as PostgreSQL.
      Please read the section above about server installations for an explanation of the database
      configuration. The <emphasis role="italic">dhis.conf</emphasis> configuration file is located
      in the <emphasis role="italic">conf</emphasis> folder. Remember to restart the Live package
      for your changes to take effect. The server port is 8082 by default. This can be changed by
      modifying the value in the<emphasis role="italic"> jetty.port</emphasis> configuration file
      located in the <emphasis role="italic">conf</emphasis> directory.</para>
