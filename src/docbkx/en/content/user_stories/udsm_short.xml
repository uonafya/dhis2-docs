    <title>Tanzania: Integrated Health Information Architecture</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Tanzania Mainland has come a long way in implementing and rolling out its HIS using DHIS2 technology.  Over the lapse of five years, the country has succeeded in shifting from a system that had completely outgrown itself to a nationally supported system.</emphasis></para>

    <section><para><emphasis role="bold">"How did you come so far, so rapidly?"</emphasis>is a question that the lead implementers, Wilfred Senyoni and Dr. Honest C. Kimaro, often find themselves answering. Building up local capacity is the first answer. Getting key partners and stakeholders involved very early on in the process is the second.</para></section>
    <section><para><emphasis role="bold">The combination of a highly committed team and an unrelenting attitude </emphasis>to getting the rollout done were contributors to this success story. Owing to a joint effort between the MoHSW, the University of Dar es Salaam and UiO, students and researchers have played an essential role in identifying and implementing open-source tools and technology; introducing that data collection standards; proactively engaging with communities for good usability input, and conducting "action-led research".</para></section>
    <section><para><emphasis role="bold">Local capacity building helped shape the project.</emphasis>Tanzanian project managers were quick to gauge how vital the role of building up local teams with local expertise would be in establishing a strong backbone to their system. Instilling a sense of ownership, responsibility and accountability at all levels has made a huge difference in the quality and timeliness of reported data.</para></section>
    <section><para><emphasis role="bold">"We want to drive decision-making as much as possible using this powerful analytical to the full,"</emphasis>says Wilfred Senyoni. Indeed, the interoperability of DHIS2 with other systems is helping the MoHSW to gain visibility as to where and how to tackle the most pressing health issues within Tanzania. Good examples of this are the eIDSR tool that uses DHIS2 and USSD technology to detect and respond to infectious diseases, and eLMIS interoperability with DHIS2, which compares and triangulates the service delivery data with the logistics.</para>
