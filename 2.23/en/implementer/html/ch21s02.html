      content and presentation. DocBook is a pure XML format, and is well documented. It is believed
      that only a very small subset of its features will be required in order to achieve much higher
      quality documentation for DHIS. There are hundreds of separate mark-up elements that cater to
      almost any level of technical documentation needs, but in reality, only a few dozen of these
      element will probably need to be employed to achieve high-quality documentation for DHIS 2,
      both for printed as well as on-line formats such as HTML or integrated help systems within the
      application itself. </p><p>There exist a wide range of text editors which can be used for the creation of DocBook files.
      A fairly complete list of possibilities is located <a class="link" href="http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookAuthoringTools" target="_top">here</a>. It is
      currently recommended to use the <a class="link" href="https://www.oxygenxml.com" target="_top"><span class="trademark">
          &lt;oXygen/&gt;</span>&reg; XML editor</a> for editing DocBook source files. In
      principle, any text editing program or XML editor can be used to author DocBook files. Other
      good possibilities are excellent and freely available text editor<a class="link" href="http://jedit.org/" target="_top">jEdit</a> with the XML plugin installed, or the <a class="link" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_top">cross-platform Emacs</a> text editor. Both
      of these programs support editing DocBook XML. </p><p>One of the key concepts to keep in mind when authoring documentation in DocBook, or other
presentation neutral formats, is that the <span class="bold"><strong>content </strong></span>of the document should be considered in the first instance. The <span class="bold"><strong>presentation </strong></span>of the document will take place in a separate step, where it will be rendered into
different formats, such as HTML and PDF. It is therefore important that the document is will organised and structured, with appropriate DocBook tags and structural elements being considered.</p><p>It is good practice to break your document in to various sections using the
"sect", or section element. Section elements can also be nested within each other, such as "Section 1" and "Section 2". This concept is essentially the same as <span class="trademark">Microsoft Word</span>&reg; or other word processing programs. DocBook will automatically take care of numbering the sections for you when the document is produced. Two other important elements are the "itemizedlist" and "numberedlist". These are quite similar, but an itemised list corresponds to a bulleted list, which a numbered list will be rendered with each element being numbered sequentially. Other key elements are "screenshot" and "table" which should be self-explanatory.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch21.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch21.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch21s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;21.&nbsp;DHIS2 Documentation Guide&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;21.3.&nbsp;Getting started with GitHub</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
