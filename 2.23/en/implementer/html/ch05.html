It will show that DHIS 2 can serve the purpose of both a data warehouse and an operational system.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e415"></a>5.1.&nbsp;Data warehouses and operational systems</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="italic">data warehouse</span> is commonly understood as a database used for analysis. Typically data is uploaded from various operational / transactional systems. Before data is loaded into the data warehouse it usually goes through various stages where it is cleaned for anomalies and redundancy and transformed to conform with the overall structure of the integrated database. Data is then made available for use by analysis, also known under terms such as<span class="italic"> data mining </span>and <span class="italic">online analytical processing</span>. The data warehouse design is optimized for speed of data retrieval and analysis. To improve performance the data storage is often redundant in the sense that the data is stored both in its most granular form and in an aggregated (summarized) form.</p><p>A <span class="italic">transactional system</span> (or <span class="italic">operational system</span> from a data warehouse perspective) is a system that collects, stores and modifies low level data. This system is typically used on a day-to-day basis for data entry and validation. The design is optimized for fast insert and update performance.</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/implementation_guide/data_warehouse.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div><p>There are several benefits of maintaining a data warehouse, some of them being:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Consistency:</span> It provides a common data model for all relevant data and acts as an abstraction over a potentially high number of data sources and feeding systems which makes it a lot easier to perform analysis.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Reliability:</span> It is detached from the sources where the data originated from and is hence not affected if data in the operational systems is purged or lost.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Analysis performance:</span> It is designed for maximum performance for data retrieval and analysis in contrast to operational system which are often optimized for data capture.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are however also significant challenges with a data warehouse approach:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">High cost:</span> There is a high cost associated with moving data from various sources into a common data warehouse, especially when the operational systems are not similar in nature. Often long-term existing systems (referred to as legacy systems) put heavy constraints on the data transformation process.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="italic">Data validity:</span> The process of moving data into the data warehouse is often complex and hence often not performed at regular and timely intervals. This will then leave the data users with out-dated and irrelevant data not suitable for planning and informed decision making.</p></li></ul></div><p>Due to the mentioned challenges it has lately become increasingly popular to merge the functions of the data warehouse and operational system, either into a single system which performs both tasks or with tightly integrated systems hosted together. With this approach the system provides functionality for data capture and validation as well as data analysis and manages the process of converting low-level atomic data into aggregate data suitable for analysis. This sets high standards for the system and its design as it must provide appropriate performance for both of those functions; however advances in hardware and parallel processing is increasingly making such an approach feasible.</p><p>In this regard, the DHIS 2 application is designed to serve as a tool for both data capture, validation, analysis and presentation of data. It provides modules for all of the mentioned aspects, including data entry functionality and a wide array of analysis tools such as reports, charts, maps, pivot tables and dashboard.</p><p>In addition, DHIS 2 is a part of a suite of interoperable health information systems which covers a wide range of needs and are all open-source software. DHIS 2 implements the standard for data and meta-data exhange in the health domain called SDMX-HD. There are many examples of operational systems which also implements this standard and potenitally can feed data into DHIS 2:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>iHRIS: System for management of human resource data. Examples of data which is relevant for a national data warehouse captured by this system is "number of doctors", "number of nurses" and "total number of staff". This data is interesting to compare for instance to district performance.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>OpenMRS: Medical record system being used at hospital. This system can potentially aggregate and export data on inpatient diseases to a national data warehouse.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>OpenELIS: Laboratory enterprise information system.
