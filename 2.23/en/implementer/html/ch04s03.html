It is important to notice that the mentioned styles can co-exist in a common deployment. It is perfectly feasible to have online as well as offline deployments within a single country. The general rule would be that districts and facilities should access the system online over the Internet where sufficient Internet connectivity exist, and offline systems should be deployed to districts where this is not the case. </p><p>Defining decent Internet connectivity precisely is hard but as a rule of thumb the download speed should be minimum 10 Kbyte/second and accessibility should be minimum 70% of the time. </p><p>In this regard mobile Internet modems which can be connected to a computer or laptop and access the mobile network is an extremely capable and feasible solution. Mobile Internet coverage is increasing rapidly all over the world, often provide excellent connectivity at low prices and is a great alternative to to local networks and poorly maintained fixed Internet lines. Getting in contact with national mobile network companies regarding post-paid subscriptions and potential large-order benefits can be a wort-while effort. The network coverage for each network operator in the relevant country should be investigated when deciding which deployment approach to opt for as it might differ and cover different parts of the country.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch04s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4.2.&nbsp;Online deployment&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;4.4.&nbsp;Server hosting</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
