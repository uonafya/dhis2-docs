While most reporting tools in DHIS 2 are limited in how much data they can present at the same time, the pivot tables are designed to give nice overviews with multiple data elements or indicators, and organisation units and periods (see example below). Furthermore, the dynamic features in pivoting and drill-down are very different from static spreadsheets or many web reports, and his makes it a useful tool for information users that want to do more in-depth analysis and to manipulate the views on the data more dynamically. This combined with the well-known charting capabilities of Excel, the Pivot Table tool has made it a popular analysis tool among the more advanced DHIS users for a long time. </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/implementation_guide/pivot_table.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div><p>With the recent shift towards online deployments, the offline pivot tables in Excel also provide a useful alternative to the online reporting tools as they allow for local data analysis without Internet connectivity, which can be an advantage on unstable or expensive connections. Internet is only needed to download new data from the online server, and as soon as the data exists locally, working with the pivot tables require no connectivity. The MyDatamart tool, which is explained in detail further down, helps the users to maintain a local data mart file (small database) which is updated over the Internet against the online server, and then used as an offline data source that feeds the pivot tables with data. </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e2191"></a>17.1.&nbsp;Pivot table design</h2></div></div></div><p>Typically an Excel pivot table file set up for DHIS 2 will contain multiple worksheets with one pivot table on each sheet. A table can consist of either raw data values (by data elements) or indicator values, and will usually be named based on which level of the organisation unit hierarchy the source data is aggregated by as well as the period type (frequency e.g. Monthly, Yearly) of the data. A  standard DHIS 2 pivot table file includes the following pivot tables: District Indicators, District Data Monthly, District Data Yearly, Facility Indicators, Facility Data Monthly, Facility Data Yearly. In addition there might be more specialized tables that focus on specific programs and/or other period types.</p><p>One popular feature of pivot tables is to be able to drag-and-drop the various fields between the three positions page/filter, row, and columns,  and thereby completely change the data view. These fields can be seen as dimensions to the data values and represent the dimensions in the DHIS data model; organisation unit (one field per level), data elements or indicators, periods, and then a dynamically extended lists of additional dimensions representing organisation unit/indicator/data element group sets and data element categories (see other chapters of this guide for details). In fact a dynamic pivot table is an excellent tool to represent the many dimensions created in the DHIS 2, and makes it very easy to zoom in or out on each dimension, e.g. look at raw data values by individual age groups or just by its total, or in combination with other dimensions like gender. All the dimensions created in the DHIS 2 will be reflected in the available fields list of each pivot table, and then it is up to the user to select which ones to use.</p><p>It is important to understand that the values in the pivot tables are non-editable and all the names and numbers are fetched directly from the DHIS 2 database, which makes it different from a normal spreadsheet. In order to be edited, the contents of a pivot table must be copied to a normal spreadsheet, but this is rarely needed as all the names can be edited in DHIS 2 (and then be reflected in the pivot tables on the next update). The names (captions) on each field however are editable, but not their contents (values).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch16.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch17s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Data Analysis Tools Overview&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_implementation_guide_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;17.2.&nbsp;Connecting to the DHIS 2 database</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
