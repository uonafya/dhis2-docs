      </p><p>This section lets you define which dimension of the data you want to appear as series,
        category and filter by dragging and dropping these options to the appropriate space. Only
        one dimension can be in each section. </p><p>This asks for a closer explanation. Dimension in this regard refers to the elements
        which describe the data values in the system. We have three main dimensions in the
        system:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Data: Includes data elements, indicators and datasets (reporting rates), describing
            the phenomena or event of the data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Periods: Describes when the event took place.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Organisation units: Describes where the event took place.</p></li></ol></div><p>The visualization module lets you use these dimensions completely flexible in terms of
        appearing as series, categories and filter. Understanding these concepts is most easily done
        by looking at the screenshot from the opening page below: </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/visualizer/series_category_filter.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>More formally this can be described as following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (for example periods or
            data elements) which you want to visualize in order to emphasize trends or relations in
            its data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Categories: A category is a set of elements (for example indicators or organisation
            units) for which you want to compare its data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Filter: Since most charts are two-dimensional, a filter must be used on the third
            dimension in order to use only a single element for the chart to become
            meaningful.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1878"></a>6.4.2.&nbsp;Select indicators and data elements</h3></div></div></div><p>The Data Visualizer app can display any number of indicators and data elements in a
        chart and data table. </p><p>You can select both indicators and data elements to appear together in the same chart,
        with their order of appearance the same as the order in which they are selected. </p><p>You can select indicators by choosing Indicators from the "Data" header and
        selecting an indicator group from the list of groups below it. This will make the indicators
        in the selected group appear in the list under "Available indicators" to the left.
        From that list you can double click on any indicator in order to select it, this will move
        it to the list under "Selected indicators". Alternatively you can mark one or more
        indicators and click the single-arrow button. To select all indicators you simply click on
        the double-arrow button. To deselect indicators you can do correspondingly in the
        "Selected indicators" list.</p><p>To select data elements choose Data Elements from the "Data" header. The same
        principle for selecting and deselecting indicators applies for data elements.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1889"></a>6.4.3.&nbsp;Select reporting rates</h3></div></div></div><p>The visualizer can display reporting rates in a chart, by itself or together with
        indicators and data elements. Reporting rates can be selected by choosing Reporting Rates
        from the "Data" header. Reporting rates are defined by data sets. It can be
        selected by double-clicking in the list of available data sets to the left.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1894"></a>6.4.4.&nbsp;Select fixed and relative periods</h3></div></div></div><p>Click on the "Periods" header. For fixed periods, select a period type from
        the combo box. You can select any number of fixed periods from any period type. Below the
        fixed period you will find the relative period checkboxes and you may select as many as you
        like. The names should be fairly self-descriptive and they are relative to the current date,
        meaning that if the current month is March and you select "Last month", the month
        of February will be included in the chart. You are also free to combine fixed periods and
        relative periods in the same chart. Overlapping periods will be filtered so that they only
        appear once.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1899"></a>6.4.5.&nbsp;Select organisation units</h3></div></div></div><p>You can select which organisation units to include in the chart by clicking the
        "Organisation units" header. </p><p>This section features three ways of selecting organisation units, which can be selected
        by clicking on the gear icon directly below the organisation units header. </p><p>The default mode is called "Organisation units" and lets you select the
        organisation units you want to appear in the chart from the tree. This mode also features
        three checkboxes. Checking "User org unit" will disable the organisation unit tree
        and give you the organisation unit that is related to the current/logged in user instead.
        This is also useful for administrators as they can create a meaningful "system"
        favorite with this option checked and all users will find their respective organisation unit
        when they open it. The the same concept goes for "User sub-units" and "User
        sub-x2-units". </p><p>The second mode is called "Select levels". Here you can select all
        organisation units at one or more levels. However, at the same time you also have the option
        to select parent organisation units in the tree, which makes it easy to select e.g. all
        facilities inside one or more districts. </p><p>The same thing goes for the third mode called "Select groups". Here you can
        select all organisation units inside one or more groups and parent organisation units at the
        same time.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1912"></a>6.4.6.&nbsp;Select organisation unit group sets and data element group sets</h3></div></div></div><p>Dimension tabs listed below "Organisation units" are organisation unit group
        sets and data element group sets. You are free to add groups from any of these group sets to
        your chart. Remember to add the group set in either the series, category or filters
        combobox.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1917"></a>6.4.7.&nbsp;Select additional data dimensions</h3></div></div></div><p>Following the organisation unit group sets and data element group sets additional data
        dimensions which have been configured to be used in analysis are found. Here you can add
        dimensions such as age, sex, etc. without having to add them in as detailed data element
        selections. This is useful when you want to separate these categories in your analysis.
