      partner" and "Project" are important to record as an attribute of each data
      value. To provide an example, let us suppose that an NGO is providing ART services in a given
      facility. They would need to report each month on the "ART monthly summary", which
      would be reported monthly and contain a number of data elements. The NGO and project could
      potentially change over time. In order to be able to effectively attribute data to a given NGO
      and project at any point in time, this information would need to be recorded along with each
      data value at the time of data entry. </p><p>When categories and category combinations have a type of "Attribute", they can
      serve as a means of applying a common set of attributes (e.g. Implementing partner and
      project) to a related set of data values contained in a dataset. Let us suppose we create two
      categories called "Implementing partner" and "Projects". Each of these
      categories would be created with a dimension type of "Attribute." Finally, a
      category combination called "Implementing partners and projects" would be created
      with these two categories and assigned a dimension type of "Attribute". Finally, we
      can use this dimension to apply an attribute to the dataset "ART monthly summary",
      by choosing the "Implementing partners and projects" as the "Combination of
      categories". </p><p>The following screen shot of an example data entry screen illustrates all of these
      concepts. </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/categories_dataset_attributes.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>Note that when data is entered, an "Implementing partner" and
      "Project" can be selected. Each data value recorded in this data entry screen, would
      be assigned a specific combination of these categories as an attribute. These attributes (when
      specified as a dimension) can be used in the analysis modules similar to other dimensions,
      such as the period and orgunit. In summary, when category combinations are used as attribute,
      they effectively serve as another dimension (similar to "Period" and
      "Organisationion unit") which can be used for analysis. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s06.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch05s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5.6.&nbsp;Category combinations&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_user_manual_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;5.8.&nbsp;Category option combination maintenance</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
