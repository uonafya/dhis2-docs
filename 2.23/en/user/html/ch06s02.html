      Data Entry for the orgunits you have assigned it to. A default data entry form will then be
      shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a
      column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with a non-default
      categorycombination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be
      automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions. </p><p>If you use more than one dataelement category combination you will get multiple columns in
      the data entry form with different column headings for the options. In addition to the default
      list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the
      custom form.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2142"></a>6.2.1.&nbsp;Section forms</h3></div></div></div><p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and
        are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with
        subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table, both of
        these functions are supported in section forms. This function can be accessed by choosing
        selecting the dataset and choosing the "View sections" option from the context
        menu.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataSetSection"></a>6.2.2.&nbsp;Adding a new section form</h3></div></div></div><p>Section forms are separated automatically by data element category combinations, which
        produce a spreadsheet like data entry form for each section. </p><p>When designing a section form the procedure is as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p> Set up your data set as described in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#datasets" title="6.1.&nbsp;Data sets">Section&nbsp;6.1, &#8220;Data sets&#8221;</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Data Set Section window by selecting your data set followed by the
            "View sections" option from the context menu. To add a new section to a
            section form choose the specific category combo and press "Add new". You can
            now add data elements from the "Available data element" list on the left to
            the "Selected data elements" list on the right. Data elements can be sorted
            within the section with the use of the "Move up" 
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_up.png"></span> and "Move down"
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_down.png"></span> buttons. Be
            sure to press "Save" once you have finished.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>You can only use one data element category combination per section. </p></td></tr></table></div></li><li class="listitem"><p> You may need to control how the data element sections are displayed on the final

            of your sections in the data entry form.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In Data Entry you can now start using the Section form (which will appear
            automatically when sections are available for the selected data set). Data sets which
            have section forms will automatically display the section form.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Certain data elements may need to be disabled for data entry. Within Data set
            section management, choose the section which contains these data elements and select
            Section grey field management from the context window. Pressing the "Disable"
            button will prevent data from being entered into this specific data element/category
            option during data entry.

Notice how each data element
        category has been separated into a separate section, and a data entry table has been
        automatically generated by the system. Use of section forms in combination with data element
        categories can drastically reduce the amount of time which is required to create data entry
        forms for data sets.</p><div class="screenshot"><p class="title"><b>Section form example</b></p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/section_form.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="customDataEntryForm"></a>6.2.3.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h3></div></div></div><p>When the form you want to design is to complicated for the default or section forms then
        your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full
        flexibility in term of the design. DHIS2 uses a built-in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the
        form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly
        (using the Source window in the editor). A complete reference for use of the editor can be
        found <a class="link" href="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide" target="_top">here</a>.</p><p>One of the big advantages of custom forms, is that they can be created to mimic existing
        paper aggregation forms. This makes data entry much easier for users, and should reduce the
        number of data elements which are incorrectly entered, as they are more easily identifiable
        when entering data from a paper form. </p><p>Once a custom form has been added to a data set it will be available in data entry and
        used automatically. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Custom forms are preferentially displayed over section forms. If a data set has both a
          section form and a custom form, the custom form will be displayed during data entry. Users
          will not be able to select which method they wish to input data, so be sure that your
          custom form contains all data elements which may be required. However, if using a mobile
          interface, sections forms will display preferentially over custom forms; therefore both
          can be used to support data collection depending on the method of data entry. </p></td></tr></table></div><p>To add a custom form design to a data set then first locate your data set in the Data
        set Management window and click on the Design data entry form from the context menu.</p><p>First provide a Name for the form. There are a few important buttons in the Editor that
        you must pay special attention to. The icon with four outward arrows is the full screen mode
        on/off button, which can be very useful. The there is a Source button that shows the HTML
        code for your form. </p><p>If you already have the HTML for your form then you should start by pasting it in here.
        Click on Source again to go back to preview/non-HTML mode. A blue icon under the editor
        window, "Insert data elements," allows you to add data elements to the
        form.</p><p>All the input fields need to have a link to a data element or indicator. To add new data
        elements to the form, double-click them from the data element/indicator box as shown below.
        You can also select a data element/indicator and press the "+Insert" button. You
        can switch between either data elements, totals for or indicators by pressing the respective
        buttons.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/datasets/custom_forms_data_elements1.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>You can save by clicking on the Save button, and this will not close the window. It is
        recommended to save often to ensure you do not loose your work. </p><p>When you are done or want to test your form in data entry click on &lt;Save and
        close&gt;.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2225"></a>6.2.4.&nbsp;Scripting in custom forms</h3></div></div></div><p>In custom data entry form you can use javascript to create dynamic behavior and
        customziations. The DHIS 2 data entry module provides a range of events which you can
        register for and use to perform actions at certain times. The events are registered on the
        document element. The jQuery event object and the data set identifier are always the first
        two arguments provided to the callback functions. The table below provides an overview of
        the events and when they are triggered.</p><div class="table"><a name="d0e2230"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;Data entry events</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" summary="Data entry events" border="1"><colgroup><col class="c1"><col class="c2"><col class="newCol3"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Description</th><th>Arguments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>dhis2.de.event.formLoaded</td><td>Triggered after the data entry form is rendered, but before data values are set

                tree.</td><td>Event | Org unit IDs | Org unit names | Sub org unit IDs</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>To register for such an event:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.formReady', function( event, ds ) {
  console.log( 'The form with id: ' + ds + ' is loaded!' );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.dataValueSaved', function( event, ds, dv ) {
  console.log( 'Data value: ' + dv.value + ' was saved with data element: ' + dv.de );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.completed', function( event, ds, cr ) {
  console.log( 'Form was completed for org unit: ' + cr.ou );
} );

&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p>Be careful to only use "namespaced" events like the ones in the example above
        and not general ones like "click" as the dhis2.util.on method will unregister the
        event first.</p><p>If your function only applies to certain data sets you can use the supplied data set
        identifier and shortcut your function for unwanted data sets like this:</p><pre class="screen">dhis2.de.on( 'dhis2.de.event.validationSuccess', function( event, ds ) {
  if ( $.inArray( ds, ['utXOiGbEj14', 'Re7qzHEThSC'] ) == -1 ) {
    return false;
  }
  console.log( 'Form with id: ' + ds + ' validated successfully!' );
} );</pre><p>The identifiers of the input fields in the data entry form is on the format described
        below. This format can be used to select the input fields in your script and perform actions
        on them:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;dataelementid&gt;-&lt;optioncomboid&gt;-val</pre><p>Since the data set identifier is provided for all events a feasible alternative is to
        utilize the "files" Web API resource and keep your callback functions in a single
        file, where you let the javascript code take action based on which data set is currently
        loaded.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataSetAssignmentEditor"></a>6.2.5.&nbsp;Data set assignment editor</h3></div></div></div><p>The data set assignment editor is a tool for adding and removing many data sets to
        organisation units in batch style. Start by selecting an organisation unit from the
        selection tree. In the area below the tree a grid will be displayed showing all data sets as
        columns and the child organisation units as rows.</p><p>From the grid you can now assign or unassign data sets simply by clicking on of the
        corresponding icons in the grid. If you want to assign or unassign an organisation unit to
        all data sets you can check or uncheck the checkbox next to the organisation unit. Your
        changes will automatically be saved.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Data sets and data entry forms&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_user_manual_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;User management</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
