      enabled, data will be hidden from viewing by users associated with higher levels. When
      determining whether a data record should be hidden for a specific user, the system associates
      a user with a specific approval level and compares it to the level to which the data record
      has been approved up to. A user is associated with the approval level which matches the level
      of the organisation unit(s) she is linked to, or if no approvel level exists at that level,
      the next approval level linked to an organisation unit level below herself. A user will be
      allowed to see data which has been approved up to the level immediately below her associated
      approval level. The rationale behind this is that a user must be ablet to view the data that
      has been approved below so that she can eventually view and approve it herself.</p><p>Note that if the user has been granted the <span class="italic">View unapproved
        data</span> or the <span class="italic">ALL</span> authority she will be able to
      view data irrespective of the approval status.</p><p><span class="italic">Lets consider the following example:</span> There are four
      organisation unit levels, with approval levels associated with level 2 and 4. <span class="italic">User A</span> at country level (1) gets associated with approval level 1
      since the approval level exists at the same level as the organisation unit level. <span class="italic">User B</span> gets associated with approval level 2 since there is no
      approval level directly linked to her organisation unit level and approval level 2 is the
      immediate level below. <span class="italic">User C</span> gets associated with approval
      level 2. <span class="italic">User D</span> is below all approval levels which implies
      that she can see all data entered at or below her organisation unit level.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e9073"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;20.3.&nbsp;Hiding of unapproved data</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_approval/approval_data_hiding.png" align="middle" alt="Hiding of unapproved data"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Using this example, lets consider some scenarios:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Data is entered at facility level: Only <span class="italic">User D</span>
