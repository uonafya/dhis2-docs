        of the services provided across various health programmes. This is crucial in monitoring
          "<span class="italic">reach</span>" and "<span class="italic">availability</span>" of public health services, but it lacks the ability of
        tracing the persons being provided with these services and quality of these ones. </p><p>For example, the aggregate report will show  300 pregnant women registered  for ANC and 120 women given IFA tablets or 90 women given TT injection. In an aggregate system, it is not possible to ascertain that if a particular pregnant woman registered for ANC, has also been given IFA and TT, as data only shows aggregate numbers. To understand the quality of services given to each pregnant woman registered for ANC, immunization cycle of each child or treatment of each leprosy person, etc. it is important that treatment information of each person is maintained as an individual case.</p><p>The DHIS tracker module ( also known as  DHIS Community Module  ) is an integrated module in DHIS2, built to support community health systems and facilitate a smooth integration between the community health data and aggregated data management.</p><p>The module supports definition of  types of entities which can be tracked through the system, which can be anything from persons to commodities, e.g medicine, person,.. For the types of entities defined, users can manage community health programs, such as child immunization, maternal health and e.g. allows tracking of individuals enrolled in various programs and activity planning for community health workers</p><p>The following are the  major things:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Administrating meta data - The module supports flexibly to create meta data which need for entities defined,  includes  attributes,  attribute groups, relationship types,  registration form, health programs,  program stages corresponding to the program, validations and formulas  for aggregating data value from individual cases.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Administrating entity registration - Registering a new entity, setting relationships,  enrolling this entity into a program and management of entity location.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Data entry for inputting individual data for treatment  of each entity.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Reports for individual cases.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Linking data between tracker system and aggregate management system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Provide a list of upcoming visits to better plan for daily/weekly/monthly activities at a facility or in an area. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Support the work practices around tracking entities within a health programmes.</p></li></ol></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Advantages of tracker

When an entity who is registered in the system, the application will guide the health provider  the services required for this entity through activity plan and the services  from time to time can be updated into the entity's profile. </p><p>Below is an example about the working process of Mother and child health programme described in steps depicted in picture below - </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/patients_programs/name_based_information_tracking_process.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>The process of  creating a new entity in the system is through the registration process. The entity is first registered in the system (or checked if the entity already exists in system). Searching a entity can be done through attributes defined (name, address,  e.g.). If the entity already exists in the system, the program enrollment process can continue. If the entity is not available,  new registration takes place. </p><p>For identification a entity, the health worker is first identified through any of the unique attributes or/and some attributes ( such as name, address, phone number, e.g. )  in the system. After identification, treatment cases can be updated for  the visits that they have received.</p><p>After enrolled into a health programme, the entity is provided with various services through the treatment which
          are being recorded. Based on the services of the program by the time, the system creates
          an activity plan for the entity.</p><p>Each interaction with the entity related to the case is considered to be an treatment case and these cases are recorded into the individual case. Individual case is updated with the identification of both the health worker and the entity that is receiving the service.</p><p>Finally, the individual cases and  information of entities can used for health reports.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>In some cases, health staff just need to save  health treatment cases for reaching / aggregating  data without private information of entities.
