</p><p>As a general rule, all organisation units should collect the same data using the same frequency or periodicity. A data entry form therefore is associated with a single period type to make sure data is always collected according to the correct and same periodicity across the country. </p><p>It is possible however to collect the same data elements using different period types by
        assigning the same data elements to multiple data sets with different period types, however
        then it becomes crucial to make sure no organisation unit is collecting data using both data
        sets/period types as that would create overlap and duplication of data values. If configured        correctly the aggregation service in DHIS2  will
        aggregate the data together, e.g. the monthly data from one part of the country with
        quarterly data from another part of the country into a national quarterly report. For
        simplicity and to avoid data duplication it is advised to use the same period type for
        all organisation units for the same data elements when possible. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1072"></a>3.4.2.&nbsp;Relative periods</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the fixed period types described in the previous section, DHIS 2 also support relative periods for use in the analysis modules.</p><p>When creating analytical resources within  DHIS 2  it is
        possible to make use of the relative periods functionality. The simplest scenario is when
        you want to design a monthly report that can be reused every month without having to make
        changes to the report template to accommodate for the changes in period. The relative period
        called "Last month"  allows for this, and the user can at the time of report generation
        through a report parameter select the month to use in the report. </p><p>A slightly more advanced use case is  when you want to make a monthly summary report for immunisation and want to look at the data from the current (reporting) month together with a cumulative value for the year so far. The relative period called "This year" provides such a cumulative value relative to the reporting month selecting when running the report. Other relative periods are the last 3,6, or 12 months periods which are cumulative values calculated back from the selected reporting month. If you want to create a report with data aggregated by quarters (the ones that have passed so far in the year) you can select "Last four quarters". Other relative periods are described under the reporting table section of the manual. </p><div class="table"><a name="d0e1082"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;3.5.&nbsp;</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col class="c1"><col class="c2"><col class="c3"><col class="c4"><col class="c5"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Organisation Unit</th><th>Data Element</th><th>Reporting month</th><th>So far this year</th><th>Reporting month name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gerehun CHC</td><td>Measles doses given</td><td>15</td><td>167</td><td>Oct-09</td></tr><tr><td>Tugbebu CHP</td><td>Measles doses given</td><td>17</td><td>155</td><td>Oct-09</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><br class="table-break"></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1125"></a>3.4.3.&nbsp;Aggregation of periods</h3></div></div></div><p>While data needs to be collected on a given frequency to standardise data collection and management, this does not put limitations on the period types that can be used in data analysis and reports. Just like data gets aggregated up the organisational hierarchy, data is also aggregated according to a period hierarchy, so you can create quarterly and annual reports based on data that is being collected on a Monthly basis. The defined period type for a data entry form (data set) defines the lowest level of period detail possible in a report.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e1130"></a>3.4.3.1.&nbsp;Sum and average aggregation along the period dimension</h4></div></div></div><p>When aggregating data on the period dimension there are two options for how the calculation is done, namely sum or averge. This otion is specified on a per data element in DHIS 2 through the use of the 'aggregation operator' attribute in the Add/Edit Data Elements dialog.

</p><p>Most of the data collected on a routinely basis should be aggregated by summing up the months or weeks, for instance to create  a quarterly report on Measles immunisation one would sum  up the three monthly values for "Measles doses given". 

</p><p>Other types of data that are more permanently valid over time like "Number of staff in the PHU" or an annual population estimate of "Population under 1 year" need to be aggregated differently. These values are static for all months as long as there are valid data. For example,  the "Estimated population under 1", calculated from the census data ,is the same for all months of a given year, or the number of nurses working in a given facility is the same for every month in the 6 months period the number is reported for. 

</p><p>This difference becomes important when calculating an annual value for the
          indicator morbidity service burden for a facility. The monthly head-counts are summed up for the
          12 months to get the annual headcount, while the number of staff for the PHU is calculated
          as the average of the two 6-monthly values reported through the 6-monthly staff report. So
          in this example the data element "OPD headcount" would have the aggregation
          operator "SUM" and the data element "Number of staff" would have it
          set to "AVERAGE". </p><p>Another important feature of average data elements is the validity period concept.
          Average data values are standing values for any period type within the borders of the
          period they are registered for. For example,  an annual population estimate following the calendar
          year, will have the same value for any period that falls within that year no matter what
          the period type. If the population under 1 for a given facility is 250 for the year of
          2015 that means that the value will be 250 for Jan-15, for Q3-15, for Week 12 of 2015 and
          for any period within 2015. This has implications for how  coverage indicators are
          calculated, as the full annual population will be used as denominator value even when doing
          monthly reports. If you want to look at an estimated annual coverage value for a given
          month, then you will have the option of setting the indicator to "Annualised"
          which means that a monthly coverage value will be multiplied by a factor of 12, a quarterly value by 4, in order to generate an effective yearly total. The annualised indicator feature can therefore be used to mimic the use of monthly
          population estimates. </p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.3.&nbsp;The organisation unit dimension&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_user_manual_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.5.&nbsp;Data collection vs. data analysis</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
